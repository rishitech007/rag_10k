    "item_1": "Item 1 / Business\nAmerican International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading global insurance organization. Founded in 1919, today we provide a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement products, mortgage insurance and other financial services to customers in more than 100 countries and jurisdictions. Our diverse offerings include products and services that help businesses and individuals protect their assets, manage risks and provide for retirement security. AIG common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nAIG’s key strengths include:\nWorld class insurance franchises that are leaders in their categories and are continuing to improve their operating performance;\nA diverse mix of businesses with a presence in most international markets;\nEffective capital management of the largest shareholders’ equity of any insurance company in the world*, supported by enhanced risk management;\nExecution of strategic objectives, such as our focus on growth of higher value lines of business to increase profitability and grow assets under management;\nBreadth of customers, serving over 89 percent of companies included in the Fortune Global 500; and\nImproved profitability, as demonstrated by growth in 2014 over 2013 of pre-tax operating income in our core insurance operations.\n* At June 30, 2014, the latest date for which information was available for certain foreign insurance companies.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS / AIG\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context indicates otherwise, we use the terms “AIG,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” to refer to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. We use the term “AIG Parent” to refer solely to American International Group, Inc., and not to any of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAIG’s Global Insurance Operations\nbusiness management\nOn September 1, 2014, in accordance with AIG’s previously disclosed succession plan, Peter D. Hancock assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of AIG and joined AIG’s Board of Directors. He succeeded Robert H. Benmosche, who retired and currently serves as an advisor to AIG.\nWith this transition, Mr. Hancock has announced a new leadership team and structure aimed at integrating the Company and positioning us to deliver the full capabilities of AIG to our approximately 90 million clients around the world as One AIG. We believe that by striving to provide the greatest value to our customers, we can deliver improved operating and financial performance and sustainable, profitable growth. Our strategy is focused on enhancing the value and competitive position of our insurance businesses and investing our capital where we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining strong levels of liquidity and capital.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we modified the presentation of our results to reflect our new operating structure. The new operating structure includes two reportable segments, Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, and a Corporate and Other category. Commercial Insurance has three operating segments: Property Casualty, Mortgage Guaranty and Institutional Markets. Consumer Insurance also has three operating segments: Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance. The Corporate and Other category consists of businesses and items not allocated to our reportable segments. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, AIG reported its results through two reportable segments - AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement.\nCertain of our management activities, such as investment management, enterprise risk management, liquidity management and capital management, and our balance sheet reporting, are conducted on a legal entity basis. We group our insurance-related legal entities into two categories: Non-Life Insurance Companies and Life Insurance Companies.\nNon-Life Insurance Companies include the following major property casualty and mortgage guaranty companies: National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa.(National Union); American Home Assurance Company (American Home); Lexington Insurance Company (Lexington); Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji Fire); American Home Assurance Company, Ltd. (American Home Japan); AIG Asia Pacific Insurance, Pte, Ltd.; AIG Europe Limited and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company (UGRIC).\nLife Insurance Companies include the following major operating companies: American General Life Insurance Company (American General Life); The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC); The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (U.S. Life) and AIG Fuji Life Insurance Company Limited (Fuji Life).\nItem 1 / BUSINESS / AIG\n(a) Consists of Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income. Pre-tax operating income and book value per share excluding AOCI are non-GAAP measures. See “Use of Non-GAAP Measures” for additional information.\n(b) Total consideration of approximately $7.6 billion, includes net cash proceeds of $2.4 billion and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares. Based in part on AerCap's closing price per share of $47.01 on May 13, 2014, the date the sale of ILFC to AerCap was completed.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS / AIG\nHow we Generate Revenues and Profitability\nWe earn revenues primarily from insurance premiums, policy fees from universal life insurance and investment products, and income from investments and advisory fees.\nOur operating expenses consist of policyholder benefits and losses incurred, interest credited to policyholders, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing our products, and general business expenses.\nOur profitability is dependent on our ability to properly price and manage risk on insurance and annuity products, to manage our portfolio of investments effectively, and to control costs through expense discipline.\nINVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF Our Insurance OPERATIONS\nOur Non Life Insurance Companies and Life Insurance Companies generally receive premiums and deposits well in advance of paying covered claims or benefits. In the intervening periods, we invest these premiums and deposits to generate net investment income that, along with the invested funds, is available to pay claims or benefits. As a result, we generate significant revenues from insurance investment activities.\nWe generate significant revenues in our insurance operations from investment activities.\nOur worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in corporate bonds, municipal bonds and government bonds in all of our portfolios, and, to a lesser extent, investments in high yield bonds, common stock, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments.\nThe majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.\nNon-Life Insurance Companies - Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ domestic operations have historically consisted primarily of corporate bonds, municipal bonds and government bonds. These investments provided attractive returns and limited credit risk. To meet our domestic operations’ current risk return and business objectives, our domestic Non-Life Insurance Companies have been shifting investment allocations to a broader array of investments, including structured securities, mortgage loans, equity related opportunities and other investments that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our fixed maturity securities must meet our liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current capital, risk return and business objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ international operations consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities, primarily in the markets being served. In addition, the Non-Life Insurance Companies have redeployed cash in excess of operating needs into investments consistent with the asset classes described above.\nLife Insurance Companies - The investment strategy for the portfolios of the Life Insurance Companies is largely to match the duration of our liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable. The Life Insurance Companies primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, which include corporate bonds and structured securities. To further diversify the portfolio, investments are made in alternative investments, including private equity funds, hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have achieved total returns in excess of the Life Insurance Companies’ fixed maturity security returns for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS / AIG\nCommercial Insurance\nConsumer Insurance\nCommercial Insurance is a leading provider of insurance products and services for commercial and institutional customers. It includes one of the world’s most far-reaching property casualty networks, a leading mortgage guaranty insurer and an institutional retirement and savings business. Commercial Insurance offers a broad range of products to customers through a diversified, multichannel distribution network. Customers value Commercial Insurance’s strong capital position, extensive risk management and claims experience, and its ability to be a market leader in critical lines of insurance business.\nConsumer Insurance is a unique franchise that brings together a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and property casualty products offered through multiple distribution networks. It holds long-standing, leading market positions in many of its U.S. product lines, and its global footprint provides the opportunity to pursue international growth opportunities selectively in countries with attractive markets. With its strong capital position, customer-focused service, innovative product development capabilities and strong distribution relationships across multiple channels, Consumer Insurance is well positioned to provide clients with the products they need delivered through the channels they prefer.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other includes Direct Investment book, Global Capital Markets, and AIG Parent and Other as well as certain run-off insurance businesses.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS / AIG\nGlobal Footprint\nOur Non-Life Insurance Companies net premiums written (NPW) of $34.5 billion in 2014 reflected our expansive global footprint. Based on NPW in 2013, we are the largest commercial insurer in the U.S., the largest U.S. based property casualty insurer in Europe, and the largest foreign property casualty insurer in China. In addition, AIG was first to market in many emerging markets and is well positioned to enhance its businesses in countries such as Brazil, China through strategic relationships with People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited (PICC Group), and India with the Tata Group.\nOur Life Insurance Companies premiums and deposits (P&D) of $32.6 billion in 2014 demonstrate a substantial presence in the U.S. and a meaningful share of the Japan market. P&D is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds. See Item 7. MD&A - Results of Operations for Institutional Markets, Retirement and Life for a reconciliation of P&D to premiums.\nWe have a significant international presence in both developed markets and growth economy nations, specifically in Asia Pacific, Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. We distribute our products through three major geographic regions:\n• Americas: Includes the United States, Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean and Bermuda.\n• Asia Pacific: Includes Japan, China, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Indonesia and other Asia Pacific nations.\n• EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa): Includes the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, the Russian Federation, India, the Middle East and Africa.\nIn 2014, 6.3 percent of our property casualty direct premiums were written in the state of California and 15.7 percent and 7.5 percent were written in Japan and the United Kingdom, respectively. No other state or foreign jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of such premiums.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS / AIG\nDiversified Mix of Businesses*\n(dollars in millions)\n* Represents revenues from insurance operations.

Mortgage Guaranty competes with several private providers of mortgage insurance, both well-established and new entrants to the industry, and the Federal Housing Administration, which is the largest provider of mortgage insurance in the United States. Institutional Markets competes with large domestic (both stock and mutual) life companies, as well as international life companies.\nInsurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions.

The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives.\nGlobal Capital Markets (GCM) consists of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between our subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistently with our risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.\nAIG Parent and Other consists primarily of interest expense, consolidation and eliminations, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, certain expenses related to internal controls and the financial and operating\nItem 1 / BUSINESS / consumer insurance\nplatforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and credits, net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting treatment, and equity in the earnings of AerCap.\nRun-off Insurance Business consists primarily of run-off lines of business, including excess workers’ compensation, asbestos and legacy environmental (1986 and prior); certain environmental liability businesses written prior to 2004 and certain long-duration business, primarily in Japan and the U.S.\nOther Businesses include investments in life settlements, real estate investment operations, institutional asset management operations, equipment financing operations and our remaining consumer finance business.\nAircraft Leasing consists of ILFC. On May 14, 2014, we completed the sale of 100 percent of the common stock of ILFC to AerCap Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AerCap, in exchange for total consideration of approximately $7.6 billion, including cash and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares (the AerCap Transaction). As a result of the AerCap Transaction, we own approximately 46 percent of the outstanding common stock of AerCap. We account for our interest in AerCap using the equity method of accounting. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the AerCap Transaction.\nRetained Interests includes fair value gains and losses on (i) AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering prior to their sale in 2012 and (ii) Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) assets prior to their liquidation in 2012.\nOUR EMPLOYEES\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately 65,000 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nA Review of Liability for Unpaid LOSSES and loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as loss reserves) represents the accumulation of estimates for unpaid reported losses (case reserves) and losses that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR) for the Non-Life Insurance Companies.\nWe recognize as assets the portion of this liability that is expected to be recovered from reinsurers. Loss reserves are discounted, where permitted, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Loss Reserve Development Process\nThe process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is complex and imprecise because it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events. As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process.\nWe use a number of techniques to analyze the adequacy of the established net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (net loss reserves). Using these analytical techniques, we monitor the adequacy of our established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation and other factors influencing loss costs. Our analyses also take into account emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence. We also consider specific factors that may impact losses, such as changing trends in medical costs, unemployment levels and other economic indicators, as well as changes in legislation and social attitudes that may affect decisions to file claims or the magnitude of court awards. See Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates for a description of our loss reserving process.\nBecause reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in prior year estimates are unavoidable in the insurance industry. These changes in estimates are sometimes referred to as “prior year loss development” or “reserve development.”\nA significant portion of the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ reserves are for the U.S. commercial casualty class, including excess casualty, asbestos and environmental, which tends to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settlement of claims than other types of insurance and therefore may increase the inherent risk and uncertainty with respect to our loss reserve development.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development\nThe “Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development” table presents the development of prior year net loss reserves for calendar years 2004 through 2014 for each balance sheet in that period. The information in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This table should be interpreted with care by those not familiar with its format or those who are familiar with other loss development analyses arranged in an accident year or underwriting year basis rather than the balance sheet, as shown below. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe top row of the table shows Net Reserves Held (the net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses) at each balance sheet date, net of discount. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all years prior to the balance sheet date that were unpaid as of that balance sheet date, including estimates for IBNR claims. The amount of loss reserve discount included in the net reserves at each date is shown immediately below the net reserves held. The undiscounted reserve at each date is equal to the sum of the discount and the net reserves held. For example, Net Reserves Held (Undiscounted) was $48.8 billion at December 31, 2004.\nThe next section of the table shows the original Net Undiscounted Reserves re-estimated over 10 years. This re-estimation takes into consideration a number of factors, including changes in the estimated frequency of reported claims, effects of\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nsignificant judgments, the emergence of latent exposures, and changes in medical cost trends. For example, the original undiscounted reserve of $48.8 billion at December 31, 2004, was re-estimated to $66.2 billion at December 31, 2014. The amount of the development related to losses settled or re-estimated in 2014, but incurred in 2011, is included in the cumulative development amount for years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Any increase or decrease in the estimate is reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nThe middle of the table shows Net Deficiency. This is the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years covered by the table. For example, the net loss reserve deficiency of $17.4 billion for 2004 is the difference between the original undiscounted reserve of $48.8 billion at December 31, 2004 and the $66.2 billion of re-estimated reserves at December 31, 2014. The net deficiency amounts are cumulative; in other words, the amount shown in the 2013 column includes the amount shown in the 2012 column, and so on. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.\nThe bottom portion of the table shows the Paid (Cumulative) amounts during successive years related to the undiscounted loss reserves. For example, as of December 31, 2014, AIG had paid a total of $55.4 billion of the $66.2 billion in re-estimated reserves for 2004, resulting in Remaining Reserves (Undiscounted) of $10.8 billion for 2004. Also included in this section are the Remaining Reserves (Undiscounted) and the Remaining Discount for each year.\nAs discussed in footnotes (a) and (b) below, the calendar year distribution of these Paid (Cumulative) amounts are estimates that are affected by certain transactions. These payment amounts may differ from the actual losses paid for a given accident year.\nThe following table presents loss reserves and the related loss development for 2004 through 2014 and consolidated gross liability (before discount), reinsurance recoverable and net liability recorded for each calendar year, and the re-estimation of these amounts as of December 31, 2014.(a)\n(in millions)\nNet Reserves Held(b)\n$\n47,253\n$\n57,476\n$\n62,630\n$\n69,288\n$\n72,455\n$\n67,899\n$\n71,507\n$\n70,825\n$\n68,782\n$\n64,316\n$\n61,612\nDiscount (in Reserves Held)\n1,553\n2,110\n2,264\n2,429\n2,574\n2,655\n3,217\n3,183\n3,246\n3,555\n3,077\nNet Reserves Held (Undiscounted)\n48,806\n59,586\n64,894\n71,717\n75,029\n70,554\n74,724\n74,008\n72,028\n67,871\n$\n64,689\nNet undiscounted Reserve\nre-estimated as of:\nOne year later\n53,486\n59,533\n64,238\n71,836\n77,800\n74,736\n74,919\n74,429\n72,585\n68,574\nTwo years later\n55,009\n60,126\n64,764\n74,318\n82,043\n74,529\n75,502\n75,167\n73,571\nThree years later\n56,047\n61,242\n67,303\n78,275\n81,719\n75,187\n76,023\n76,212\nFour years later\n57,618\n63,872\n70,733\n78,245\n82,422\n76,058\n77,031\nFive years later\n60,231\n67,102\n70,876\n79,098\n83,135\n77,054\nSix years later\n63,348\n67,518\n71,572\n79,813\n84,100\nSeven years later\n63,928\n68,233\n72,286\n80,770\nEight years later\n64,532\n69,023\n73,356\nNine years later\n65,261\n70,029\nTen years later\n66,162\nNet Deficiency on net reserves held\n(17,356)\n(10,443)\n(8,462)\n(9,053)\n(9,071)\n(6,500)\n(2,307)\n(2,204)\n(1,543)\n(703)\nNet Deficiency related to asbestos\nand environmental (A&E)\n(3,157)\n(2,228)\n(2,019)\n(2,000)\n(1,951)\n(1,799)\n(297)\n(268)\n(192)\n(124)\nNet Deficiency excluding A&E\n(14,199)\n(8,215)\n(6,443)\n(7,053)\n(7,120)\n(4,701)\n(2,010)\n(1,936)\n(1,351)\n(579)\nPaid (Cumulative) as of:\nOne year later\n14,910\n15,326\n14,862\n16,531\n24,267\n15,919\n17,661\n19,235\n18,758\n17,745\nTwo years later\n24,377\n25,152\n24,388\n31,791\n36,164\n28,428\n30,620\n31,766\n31,265\nThree years later\n31,296\n32,295\n34,647\n40,401\n46,856\n38,183\n40,091\n41,464\nFour years later\n36,804\n40,380\n40,447\n48,520\n53,616\n45,382\n47,379\nFive years later\n43,162\n44,473\n46,474\n53,593\n58,513\n51,104\nSix years later\n46,330\n49,552\n50,391\n57,686\n62,734\nSeven years later\n50,462\n52,243\n53,545\n61,221\nEight years later\n52,214\n54,332\n56,424\nNine years later\n53,693\n56,516\nTen years later\n55,375\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nRemaining Reserves (Undiscounted)\n10,787\n13,513\n16,932\n19,549\n21,366\n25,950\n29,652\n34,748\n42,306\n50,829\nRemaining Discount\n1,342\n1,474\n1,632\n1,797\n1,978\n2,143\n2,309\n2,516\n2,701\n2,888\nRemaining Reserves\n$\n9,445\n$\n12,039\n$\n15,300\n$\n17,752\n$\n19,388\n$\n23,807\n$\n27,343\n$\n32,232\n$\n39,605\n$\n47,941\nNet Liability, End of Year\n$\n48,806\n$\n59,586\n$\n64,894\n$\n71,717\n$\n75,030\n$\n70,554\n$\n74,724\n$\n74,008\n$\n72,028\n$\n67,871\n$\n64,689\nReinsurance Recoverable, End of Year\n14,624\n19,693\n17,369\n16,212\n16,803\n17,487\n19,644\n20,320\n19,209\n17,231\n15,648\nGross Liability, End of Year\n63,430\n79,279\n82,263\n87,929\n91,833\n88,041\n94,368\n94,328\n91,237\n85,102\n$\n80,337\nRe-estimated Net Liability\n66,162\n70,029\n73,356\n80,770\n84,100\n77,054\n77,031\n76,212\n73,571\n68,574\nRe-estimated Reinsurance Recoverable\n21,765\n24,548\n20,819\n19,317\n18,793\n18,634\n16,709\n18,456\n19,065\n17,221\nRe-estimated Gross Liability\n87,927\n94,577\n94,175\n100,087\n102,893\n95,688\n93,740\n94,668\n92,636\n85,795\nCumulative Gross\nRedundancy (Deficiency)\n$\n(24,497)\n$\n(15,298)\n$\n(11,912)\n$\n(12,158)\n$\n(11,060)\n$\n(7,647)\n$\n$\n(340)\n$\n(1,399)\n$\n(693)\n(a) During 2009, we deconsolidated Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. and sold 21st Century Insurance Group and HSB Group, Inc. The sales and deconsolidation are reflected in the table above as a reduction in December 31, 2009 net reserves of $9.7 billion and as an $8.6 billion increase in paid losses for the years 2000 through 2008 to remove the reserves for these divested entities from the ending balance.\n(b) The increase in Net Reserves Held from 2009 to 2010 is partially due to the $1.7 billion in Net Reserves Held by Fuji Fire, which was acquired in 2010. The decrease in 2011 is due to the cession of asbestos reserves described in Item 7. MD&A - Insurance Reserves - Non-Life Insurance Companies- Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\nThe Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014 differs from the total reserves reported in the annual statements filed with state insurance departments and, when applicable, with foreign regulatory authorities primarily for the following reasons:\n• Reserves for certain foreign operations are not required or permitted to be reported in the United States for statutory reporting purposes, including contingency reserves for catastrophic events;\n• Statutory practices in the United States require reserves to be shown net of applicable reinsurance recoverable; and\n• Unlike statutory financial statements, our consolidated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses excludes the effect of intercompany transactions.\nGross loss reserves are calculated without reduction for reinsurance recoverable and represent the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and IBNR, net of estimated salvage and subrogation. We review the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves. A reconciliation of activity in the Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor further discussion of asbestos and environmental reserves, see Item 7. MD&A - Insurance Reserves - Non-Life Insurance Companies- Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\nReinsurance Activities\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes.\nOur subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we are required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\nOver the last several years, the Non-Life Insurance Companies revised the ceded reinsurance framework and strategy to improve capital management and support our global product line risk and profitability objectives. As a result of adopting the revised framework and strategy, many individual reinsurance contracts were consolidated into more efficient global programs and reinsurance ceded to third parties in support of risk and capital management objectives has decreased for the full year\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\n2014 compared to 2013. We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.\nReinsurance markets include:\n• Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n• Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n• Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\nThe form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n• proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and losses to reinsurers;\n• non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n• facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\nIn certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation.\nIn 2014, we continued our strategy to take advantage of the pricing differential between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. In December 2014, we entered into capital markets reinsurance transactions, effective as of January 1, 2015, with Tradewynd Re Ltd., which will provide $500 million of indemnity reinsurance protection against U.S., Caribbean, Canadian, Mexican and Gulf of Mexico named storms and U.S., Caribbean, Mexican and Canadian earthquakes. To fund its potential obligations to AIG, Tradewynd Re Ltd. issued three tranches of notes, one with a one-year term and two with three-year terms. The transaction provides fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through December 2015 (on the one-year tranche) and December 2017 (on the three-year tranches). As of January 2015, our outstanding catastrophe bond issuances result in us having $925 million of indemnity reinsurance protection outstanding in the capital markets.\nSee Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management - Insurance Operations Risks - Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks - Reinsurance Recoverable for a summary of significant reinsurers.\nREGULATion\nOur operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nThe following table provides a general overview of our primary regulators and related bodies and a brief description of their oversight with respect to us and our subsidiaries, including key regulations or initiatives that we are currently, or may in the future be, subject to. Such regulations and initiatives, both in the United States and abroad, are discussed in more detail following the table.\nU.S. Federal Regulation\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB): Oversees and regulates financial institutions, including nonbank systemically important financial institutions (nonbank SIFIs). We are currently subject to the FRB’s examination, supervision and enforcement authority, and certain reporting requirements, as a nonbank SIFI.\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC): Charters, regulates and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC supervises and regulates AIG Federal Savings Bank, our trust-only federal thrift subsidiary.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Oversees and regulates the U.S. securities and security-based swap markets, U.S. mutual funds, U.S. broker-dealers and U.S. investment advisors. Principal regulator of the mutual funds offered by our broker-dealer subsidiaries. The SEC is in the process of implementing rules and regulations governing reporting, execution and margin requirements for security-based swaps entered into within the U.S or by U.S. persons. Our security-based swap activities conducted by GCM are likely to be subject to certain of these rules and regulations.\nCommodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): Oversees and regulates the U.S. swap, commodities and futures markets. The CFTC has begun implementing and is continuing to implement rules and regulations governing reporting, execution, margin and other requirements for swaps entered into within the U.S. or involving U.S. persons. Our swap activities conducted by GCM are subject to certain of these rules and regulations.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank): Dodd-Frank has effected comprehensive changes to financial services regulation and subjects us, or may subject us, as applicable, to additional federal regulation, including:\n• enhanced prudential standards for nonbank SIFIs (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, capital planning, stress tests, liquidity requirements, corporate governance requirements, contingent capital requirements, counterparty credit limits, an early remediation regime process and recovery and resolution planning);\n• limitations on proprietary trading or covered fund activities, if the FRB decides to impose certain elements of Section 619 of Dodd-Frank (referred to as the “Volcker Rule”) on nonbank SIFIs;\n• financial sector concentration limits; and\n• increased regulation and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions.\nU.S. State Regulation\nState Insurance Regulators: Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and other jurisdictions in which they do business. Regulation is generally derived from statutes that delegate supervisory and regulatory powers to a state insurance regulator, and primarily relates to the insurer’s financial condition, corporate conduct and market conduct activities.\nNAIC Standards: The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is a standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. The NAIC itself is not a regulator, but through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer review and coordinate regulatory oversight.\nForeign Regulation\nFinancial Stability Board (FSB): Consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The FSB itself is not a regulator, but it coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes implementation of regulatory, supervisory and other financial policies.\nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS): Represents insurance regulators and supervisors of more than 200 jurisdictions in nearly 140 countries and seeks to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision. The IAIS itself is not a regulator, but the FSB has directed the IAIS to create standards on issues such as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk and corporate governance and incorporate them into IAIS’ Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). The FSB also charged IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. Based on IAIS’ assessment template, the FSB identified AIG as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII), which may subject us to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision, enhanced liquidity and strategic risk management planning, basic capital requirements and higher loss absorbency capital requirements. The IAIS is also developing ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. In connection with ComFrame, the IAIS is in the process of developing a risk-based global insurance capital standard applicable to IAIGs. AIG currently meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG.\nEuropean Union (EU): Certain financial services firms with regulated entities in the EU, such as us, are subject to supplementary supervision, which seeks to enable supervisors to perform consolidated insurance group supervision at the level of the ultimate parent entity. The objective of supplementary supervision is to detect, monitor, manage and control group risks. The UK Prudential Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom’s prudential regulator, is our EU supervisory coordinator. In addition, the Financial Conduct Authority has oversight of AIG’s European operations for consumer protection and competition matters. The EU has also established a set of regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) that include, among other things, risk mitigation, risk management and regulatory reporting, which are effective, and clearing requirements expected to become effective in 2015.\nThe EU’s Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which is expected to become effective in 2016, includes minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we could be subjected to Solvency II standards.\nRegulation of Foreign Insurance Company Subsidiaries: Generally, our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries also regulate rates on various types of policies.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nFederal Reserve Supervision\nDue to the determination of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) that we should be regulated by the FRB as a nonbank SIFI pursuant to Section 113 of Dodd-Frank, we have been since July 2013 subject to the FRB’s examination, supervision and enforcement authority, and certain reporting requirements as a nonbank SIFI. Dodd-Frank requires that the Council reevaluate its determination annually; however, the Council’s 2014 annual reevaluation did not result in a change to our nonbank SIFI status, and we remain regulated by the FRB.\nDodd-Frank has effected comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and oversight bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process that is under way and is anticipated to continue over the next few years.\nAs required by Dodd-Frank, the FRB has adopted enhanced prudential standards (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, requirements to submit annual capital plans to the FRB demonstrating the ability to satisfy the required capital ratios under baseline and stressed conditions, and stress-testing requirements) for bank holding companies with $50 billion (and in some cases, $10 billion) or more in total consolidated assets and certain foreign banking organizations. The FRB\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nhas also adopted liquidity coverage ratio and supplemental leverage ratio requirements for a subset of large banking organizations. These requirements do not apply to nonbank SIFIs. Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to tailor its application of enhanced prudential standards to different companies on an individual basis or by category, and the FRB has indicated that it intends to assess the business model, capital structure and risk profile of nonbank SIFIs to determine how enhanced prudential standards should apply to them, and, if appropriate, to tailor the application of these standards for nonbank SIFIs by order or regulation. We cannot predict what enhanced prudential standards the FRB will promulgate for nonbank SIFIs, either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses. The FRB has exercised general examination, supervision and enforcement authority over us since we were determined to be a nonbank SIFI in July 2013. The FRB has focused its general supervisory authority over us in several areas, including financial and control related reporting, oversight of a capital planning and capital analysis and review process, model governance and validation, operational risk management, recovery planning and resolution planning. We cannot predict how the FRB’s continuing exercise of its general supervisory authority over us as a nonbank SIFI will develop, although the FRB could, as a prudential matter, for example, limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of AIG Common Stock or acquire or enter into other businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings. In 2014, the FRB conducted a quantitative impact study to evaluate the potential effects of a revised regulatory capital framework on nonbank SIFIs that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activity. The FRB has not released any results or conclusions related to this study. We also note that in December 2014, Congress adopted changes to Section 171 of Dodd-Frank in order to clarify that the FRB has the flexibility to tailor capital rules specifically for certain insurance activities and is not bound to impose capital standards and quantitative requirements generally applicable to insured depository institutions and bank holding companies. We cannot predict with any certainty, however, what capital rules, if any, the FRB may impose on insurers.\nAs a nonbank SIFI, we anticipate we will be subject to:\n• stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses due to adverse economic conditions;\n• stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements;\n• management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of severe financial distress (requirements that we are already subject to); and\n• an early remediation regime process to be administered by the FRB.\nFurthermore, if the Council were to make an additional separate determination that AIG poses a “grave threat” to U.S. financial stability, we would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15:1 and the FRB may:\n• limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become affiliated with another company;\n• restrict our ability to offer specified financial products;\n• require us to terminate specified activities;\n• impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; and\n• with approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.\nAs part of its general prudential supervisory powers, the FRB has the authority to limit our ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible for us to engage in if we do not satisfy certain requirements. In addition, if we were to seek to acquire a stake in certain financial companies, Dodd-Frank would require us to obtain the prior authorization of the FRB.\nOther Effects of Dodd-Frank\nIn addition, Dodd-Frank may also have the following effects on us:\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\n• As a nonbank SIFI, we are currently required to provide on an annual basis (or more frequently, if required) to the FRB and FDIC a plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, which must, among other things, provide a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of our material entities, organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems. We continue to update and refine our resolution plan, which was originally submitted to regulators on July 1, 2014. Our next resolution plan is required to be submitted to the FRB and FDIC on July 1, 2015. If the FRB and FDIC jointly determine, based on their review of the plan, that it is not credible or would not facilitate our orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code, they may require us to re-submit an amended plan. If the re-submitted plan also fails to meet regulatory expectations, the FRB and FDIC may exercise their authority under Dodd-Frank to impose more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, restrict our growth, activities, or operations, require us to divest assets and operations, or otherwise increase their level of supervision of us.\n• The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.\n• Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company whose largest United States subsidiary is an insurer (such as us) may be subject to a special resolution process outside the federal bankruptcy code. That process is to be administered by the FDIC upon a coordinated determination by the director of the Federal Insurance Office and the FRB, either at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury or on their own initiative, and in consultation with the FDIC, that such a financial company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability.\n• Dodd-Frank provides for significantly increased regulation of and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions that could affect various activities of AIG and its insurance and financial services subsidiaries, including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps (which are regulated by the CFTC) and security-based swaps (which are regulated by the SEC), (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated exchanges or electronic facilities for certain swaps and security-based swaps and (iii) margin and collateral requirements. Although the CFTC has not yet finalized certain requirements, many other requirements have taken effect, such as swap reporting, the mandatory clearing of certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, and the mandatory trading of certain swaps on swap execution facilities or exchanges. The SEC has proposed, but not yet finalized, rules with respect to certain of the regulations and restrictions noted above governing security-based swaps. These regulations have affected and may further affect various activities of AIG and its insurance and financial services subsidiaries as rules are finalized to implement additional elements of the regulatory regime.\nSimilar regulations have been proposed or adopted outside the United States. For instance, the EU has also established a set of new regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities under EMIR. These requirements include, among other things, various risk mitigation, risk management and regulatory reporting requirements that have already become effective and clearing requirements that are expected to become effective in 2015. These requirements could result in increased administrative costs with respect to our EU derivatives activities and overlapping or inconsistent regulation depending on the ultimate application of cross-border regulatory requirements between and among U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n• Dodd-Frank mandated a study to determine whether stable value contracts should be included in the definition of \"swap.\" If that study concludes that stable value contracts are swaps, Dodd-Frank authorizes certain federal regulators to determine whether an exemption from the definition of a swap for stable value contracts is appropriate and in the public interest. Certain of our affiliates participate in the stable value contract business. We cannot predict what regulations might emanate from the aforementioned study or be promulgated applicable to this business in the future.\n• Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the United States Department of the Treasury (Department of the Treasury) headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the Council. On December 12, 2013, the FIO released a Dodd-Frank mandated study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States. The report concluded that the uniformity and efficiency of the current state based regulatory system could be improved and highlighted areas in which Federal involvement is recommended. In the near-term, the FIO recommended that the states undertake reforms regarding capital adequacy, reform of insurer resolution practices, and marketplace regulation.\n• Dodd-Frank established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent bureau within the FRB to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB's general jurisdiction, although the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nDevelopment has since transferred authority to the CFPB to investigate mortgage insurance practices. Broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity.\n• Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans, such as loan fees, prepayment fees and other charges, and imposes certain duties on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan.\nDodd-Frank imposes various assessments on financial companies, including, as applicable to us, fees for our supervision by the FRB and assessments to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have to take account of the amounts paid by us into state guaranty funds).\nWe cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings. However, it is possible that such effect could be materially adverse. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulation for additional information.\nOther Regulatory Developments\nAs described below, AIG has been designated as a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII).\nIn addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are continuing to review the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The FSB, consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the IAIS, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body’s Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). IAIS’s ICPs form the baseline threshold against which countries’ financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority.\nThe FSB has also charged the IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. The IAIS has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector, if any, could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector (e.g., commercial and investment banking, securities trading, etc.). The IAIS has provided its assessment template to the FSB. Based on this assessment template, on July 18, 2013, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, identified an initial list of G-SIIs, which includes AIG. G-SIIs will be designated on an annual basis, and AIG was redesignated as a G-SII by the FSB on November 6, 2014. The IAIS intends G-SIIs to be subject to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision, enhanced liquidity and strategic risk management planning; basic capital requirements and higher loss absorbency (HLA) capital requirements. The IAIS finalized its basic capital requirement (BCR) in October 2014. The BCR covers all group activities and is required to be reported to national authorities on a confidential basis beginning in 2015. The BCR will serve as the initial foundation for the application of HLA capital requirements, which the IAIS intends to be calculated in part based on engagement in non-traditional and non-insurance activities. It is expected that the IAIS will develop HLA capital requirements by the end of 2015 and the G-SII policy framework will be fully implemented by 2019.\nThe IAIS is also developing ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. In connection with ComFrame, the IAIS is in the process of developing a risk-based global insurance capital standard (ICS) applicable to IAIGs. As currently delineated under ComFrame, AIG meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG. ComFrame requirements are expected to be finalized in\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\n2018, and the IAIS is conducting a field testing of ComFrame, including the ICS, ahead of that deadline. It is expected that implementation of ComFrame and the ICS would begin in 2019.\nLegislation in the European Union could also affect our international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to become effective on January 1, 2016, reforms the insurance industry’s solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. Solvency II is expected to be accompanied by Omnibus II, an EU proposal for a directive that also contains provisions for the capital treatment of products with long-term guarantees. Additionally, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority recently introduced interim guidelines effective January 1, 2014 that provide regulators in EU Member States with a framework to ensure that insurers make demonstrable progress towards meeting Solvency II requirements in 2016. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we, along with other U.S.-based insurance companies, could be required to be supervised under Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed “equivalent” is still under consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so we are not currently able to predict the impact of Solvency II.\nWe expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.\nRegulation of Insurance Subsidiaries\nCertain states and other jurisdictions require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such jurisdictions and are controlled by other entities. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the entity that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercompany services and transfers of assets, including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary, within the holding company system. Our subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those jurisdictions that have such requirements.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to the financial condition of the insurers and their corporate conduct and market conduct activities. This includes approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including with respect to risk-based capital, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes and enterprise risk management and corporate governance requirements. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies.\nIn the U.S., the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Virtually every state has adopted, in substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which allows states to act upon the results of RBC calculations, and provides for four incremental levels of regulatory action regarding insurers whose RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those levels of action range from the requirement to submit a plan describing how an insurer would regain a specified RBC ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. The RBC formula computes a risk-adjusted surplus level by applying discrete factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. These factors are developed to be risk-sensitive so that higher factors are applied to items exposed to greater risk. The statutory surplus of each of our U.S.-based Non-Life Insurance Companies and Life Insurance Companies exceeded RBC minimum required levels as of December 31, 2014.\nIf any of our insurance entities fell below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be our intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of support to that entity. For additional information, see Item 7. MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries - Non-Life Insurance Companies and - Life Insurance Companies.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nThe NAIC’s Model Regulation “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies” (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees (ULSGs). NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to these guarantees, including certain ULSGs. See Item 1A - Risk Factors and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for risks and additional information related to these statutory reserving requirements.\nThe NAIC has undertaken the Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) which focuses on a review of insurance solvency regulations throughout the U.S. financial regulatory system and is expected to lead to a set of long-term solvency modernization goals. SMI is broad in scope, but the NAIC has stated that its focus will include the U.S. solvency framework, group solvency issues, capital requirements, international accounting and regulatory standards, reinsurance and corporate governance.\nA substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements, licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and therefore these subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.\nIn addition to licensing requirements, our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local government, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including our subsidiaries, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.\nSee Item 7. MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Regulation and Supervision and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 1 / BUSINESS\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT AIG\nOur corporate website is www.aig.com.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORs\nInvesting in AIG involves risk. In deciding whether to invest in AIG, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. Any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect AIG. These factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Further, many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nMARKET CONDITIONS\nDifficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our businesses are highly dependent on the economic environment, both in the U.S. and around the world. Extreme market events, such as the global financial crisis during 2008 and 2009, have at times led, and could in the future lead, to a lack of liquidity, highly volatile markets, a steep depreciation in asset values across all classes, an erosion of investor and public confidence, and a widening of credit spreads. Concerns and events beyond our control, such as uncertainty as to the U.S. debt ceiling, the continued funding of the U.S. government, U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, the U.S. housing market, oil prices and concerns about European sovereign debt risk and the European banking industry, have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect liquidity, increase volatility, decrease asset prices, erode confidence and lead to wider credit spreads. Difficult economic conditions could also result in increased unemployment and a severe decline in business across a wide range of industries and regions. These market and economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nUnder difficult economic or market conditions, we could experience reduced demand for our products and an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Contract holders may choose to defer or cease paying insurance premiums. Other ways in which we could be negatively affected by economic conditions include, but are not limited to:\n• declines in the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio, including declines attributable to rapid increases in interest rates;\n• increased credit losses;\n• declines in the value of other assets;\n• impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets;\n• additional statutory capital requirements;\n• limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;\n• a decline in new business levels and renewals;\n• a decline in insured values caused by a decrease in activity at client organizations;\n• an increase in liability for future policy benefits due to loss recognition on certain long-duration insurance contracts;\n• higher borrowing costs and more limited availability of credit;\n• an increase in policy surrenders and cancellations; and\n• a write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC).\nSustained low interest rates may materially and adversely affect our profitability. Recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates relative to historical levels. Sustained low interest rates can negatively affect the performance of our investment securities and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment portfolios. If a low interest rate environment persists, we may experience slower investment income growth. Due to practical and capital markets limitations, we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities. Continued low interest rates could also impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving\nItem 1A / risk factors\nfor our products at the time they were sold and issued. Changes in interest rates may be correlated with inflation trends, which would impact our loss trends.\nInvestment Portfolio, Concentration of Investments, Insurance and other Exposures\nThe performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates. Our investment securities are subject to market risks and uncertainties. In particular, interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political issues and other factors beyond our control. Changes in monetary policy or other factors may cause interest rates to rise, which would adversely affect the value of the fixed income securities that we hold and could adversely affect our ability to sell these securities. In addition, the evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairments, which may occur if interest rates rise, is a quantitative and qualitative process that is subject to significant management judgment. For a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain market risk factors, see Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management - Market Risk Management. Furthermore, our alternative investment portfolio includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through operating income and are therefore subject to significant volatility. In an economic downturn or declining market, the reduction in our investment income due to decreases in the fair value of alternative investments could have a material adverse effect on operating income.\nOur investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy. Our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our investment portfolio. We have concentrations in real estate and real estate-related securities, including residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage loans. We also have significant exposures to financial institutions and, in particular, to money center and global banks; certain industries, such as energy and utilities; U.S. state and local government issuers and authorities; PICC Group, PICC P&C and AerCap, as a result of our strategic investments; and Euro Zone financial institutions, governments and corporations. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. Our ability to sell assets concentrated in such areas may be limited.\nConcentration of our insurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects. We may be exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance policies, derivatives and other obligations that we undertake for customers and counterparties. We manage these concentration risks by monitoring the accumulation of our exposures by factors such as exposure type, industry, geographic region, counterparty and other factors. We also seek to use reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that exceed the limits we wish to retain. In certain circumstances, however, these risk management arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective for certain exposures. Also, our exposure may be so large that even a slightly adverse experience compared to our expectations may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition, or result in additional statutory capital requirements for our subsidiaries.\nOur valuation of investment securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our investment securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be cases where certain assets in normally active markets with significant observable data become inactive with insufficient observable data due to the financial environment or market conditions in effect at that time. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. These values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or secured lending transaction may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nItem 1A / risk factors\nReserves and Exposures\nOur consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events. Events such as hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, explosions and fires, cyber-crimes, product defects, pandemic and other highly contagious diseases, mass torts and other catastrophes have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future. In addition, we recognize the scientific consensus that climate change is a reality of increasing concern, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming atmosphere and ocean, diminished snow and ice, and sea level rise. We understand that climate change potentially poses a serious financial threat to society as a whole, with implications for the insurance industry in areas such as catastrophe risk perception, pricing and modeling assumptions. Because there is significant variability associated with the impacts of climate change, we cannot predict how physical, legal, regulatory and social responses may impact our business.\nSuch catastrophic events, and any relevant regulations, could expose us to:\n• widespread claim costs associated with property, workers’ compensation, A&H, business interruption and mortality and morbidity claims;\n• loss resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets;\n• limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;\n• loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumptions made in product pricing;\n• declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other entities whose securities we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to, including reinsurers, and declines in the value of investments; and\n• significant interruptions to our systems and operations.\nCatastrophic events are generally unpredictable. Our exposure to catastrophes depends on various factors, including the frequency and severity of the catastrophes, the rate of inflation and the value and geographic concentration of insured property and people. Vendor models and proprietary assumptions and processes that we use to manage catastrophe exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumptions or estimates.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes could require us to pay the insured beyond the provisions of the original insurance policy and may prohibit the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated catastrophe claims.\nFor further details on potential catastrophic events, including a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management -Insurance Operations Risks.\nInsurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss expenses. We regularly review the adequacy of the established liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and conduct extensive analyses of our reserves during the year. Our loss reserves, however, may develop adversely. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process, particularly for long-tail casualty lines of business. These include, but are not limited to, general liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental, workers' compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability, Directors and Officers and products liability.\nWhile we use a number of analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, reserves may be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be due to difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in inflation, unemployment duration, or other social or economic factors affecting claims, including the judicial environment. Any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year or number of years. For a further discussion of our loss reserves, see Item 7. MD&A - Insurance Reserves -Non-Life Insurance Companies and Critical Accounting Estimates - Insurance Liabilities - Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (Non-Life Insurance Companies).\nItem 1A / risk factors\nReinsurance may not be available or affordable and may not be adequate to protect us against losses. Our subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy to optimize the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and the capital markets, such as through the utilization of catastrophe bonds, to manage risks more efficiently. While reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay claims for losses insured under our policies, it does make the reinsurer liable to them for the reinsured portion of the risk. For this reason, reinsurance is an important tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and to mitigate losses from catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. For example, reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain after a year with a large number of major catastrophes. As a result, we may, at certain times, be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms. In that case, we would have to accept an increase in exposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by our subsidiaries or seek alternatives in line with our risk limits. Additionally, we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiaries’ reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured by collateral or does not benefit from other credit enhancements. We also bear the risk that a reinsurer may be unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverable for any reason, including that (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the parties of the contract, (ii) the terms of the contract cannot be legally enforced, (iii) the terms of the contract are interpreted by a court or arbitration panel differently than intended, (iv) the reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated due to a flawed design of the reinsurance structure, terms or conditions, or (v) a change in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of the laws and regulations, materially impacts a reinsurance transaction. The insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers, or inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of our contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide the same levels of protection as traditional reinsurance transactions and any disruption, volatility and uncertainty in the catastrophe bond market, such as following a major catastrophe event, may limit our ability to access such market on terms favorable to us or at all. Also, to the extent that we intend to utilize catastrophe bond transactions based on an industry loss index rather than on actual losses incurred by us, this would result in residual risk. Our inability to obtain adequate reinsurance or other protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist attacks. Further, the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited. As a result, we rely heavily on the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which provides U.S. government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incidents in the United States. TRIA was reauthorized in January 2015 and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020. Under TRIA, once our losses for certain acts of terrorism exceed a deductible equal to 20 percent of our commercial property and casualty insurance premiums for covered lines for the prior calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for losses in excess of our deductible, starting at 85 percent of losses in 2015, and reducing by one percentage point each year, ending at 80 percent in 2020, up to a total industry program limit of $100 billion. TRIA does not cover losses in certain lines of business such as consumer property and consumer casualty.\nFor additional information on our reinsurance recoverable, see Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management - Insurance Operations Risks - Reinsurance Recoverable.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AND CREDIT\nAIG Parent’s ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited. As a holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends on AIG Common Stock and to make payments due on its obligations, including its outstanding debt. The majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments or advance funds to AIG Parent in the future because of the need to support their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits. The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments, dividends or distributions in an amount sufficient to enable AIG Parent to meet its cash requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations, our ability to pay dividends or our ability to meet our debt service obligations.\nOur internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt, maturing debt obligations and to meet any statutory capital requirements of our subsidiaries. If our liquidity is insufficient to meet our needs, we may at the time need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be prohibitively expensive. The availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit, regulatory actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity. It is also possible\nItem 1A / risk factors\nthat, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, and downgrades in our credit ratings, may limit our ability to access external capital markets at times and on terms favorable to us to meet our capital and liquidity needs or prevent our accessing the external capital markets or other financing sources. For a further discussion of our liquidity, see Item 7. MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nAIG Parent’s ability to support our subsidiaries is limited. AIG Parent has in the past and expects to continue to provide capital to our subsidiaries as necessary to maintain regulatory capital ratios, comply with rating agency requirements and meet unexpected cash flow obligations. If AIG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.\nOur subsidiaries may not be able to generate cash to meet their needs due to the illiquidity of some of their investments. Our subsidiaries have investments in certain securities that may be illiquid, including certain fixed income securities and certain structured securities, private company securities, investments in private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans, finance receivables and real estate. Collectively, investments in these assets had a fair value of $60 billion at December 31, 2014. Adverse real estate and capital markets, and tighter credit spreads, have in the past, and may in the future, materially adversely affect the liquidity of our other securities portfolios, including our residential and commercial mortgage-related securities portfolios. In the event additional liquidity is required by one or more of our subsidiaries and AIG Parent is unable to provide it, it may be difficult for these subsidiaries to generate additional liquidity by selling, pledging or otherwise monetizing these less liquid investments.\nA downgrade in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance companies could prevent them from writing new business and retaining customers and business. Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. IFS ratings measure an insurance company’s ability to meet its obligations to contract holders and policyholders. High ratings help maintain public confidence in a company’s products, facilitate marketing of products and enhance its competitive position. Downgrades of the IFS ratings of our insurance companies could prevent these companies from selling, or make it more difficult for them to succeed in selling, products and services, or result in increased policy cancellations, termination of assumed reinsurance contracts, or return of premiums. Under credit rating agency policies concerning the relationship between parent and subsidiary ratings, a downgrade in AIG Parent’s credit ratings could result in a downgrade of the IFS ratings of our insurance subsidiaries.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could require us to post additional collateral and result in the termination of derivative transactions. Credit ratings estimate a company’s ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability of financing. A downgrade of our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies would require us to post additional collateral payments related to derivative transactions to which we are a party, and could permit the termination of these derivative transactions. This could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of further downgrades of two notches to our long-term senior debt ratings, AIG would be required to post additional collateral of $153 million, and certain of our counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts.\nBusiness and operations\nInterest rate fluctuations, increased surrenders, declining investment returns and other events may require our subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of DAC and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits. We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. DAC represents deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. The recovery of DAC is generally dependent upon the future profitability of the related business, but DAC amortization varies based on the type of contract. For long-duration traditional business, DAC is generally amortized in proportion to premium revenue and varies with lapse experience. Actual lapses in excess of expectations can result in an acceleration of DAC amortization.\nDAC for investment-oriented products is generally amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are affected by a number of assumptions, including current and expected interest rates, net investment income and spreads, net realized gains and losses, fees, surrender rates, mortality experience and equity market returns and volatility. If actual and/or future estimated gross profits are less than originally expected, then the amortization of DAC would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is known and would result in a charge to income. For example, if interest rates rise rapidly\nItem 1A / risk factors\nand significantly, customers with policies that have interest crediting rates below the current market may seek competing products with higher returns and we may experience an increase in surrenders and withdrawals of life and annuity contracts, resulting in a decrease in future profitability and an acceleration of the amortization of DAC.\nWe also periodically review products for potential loss recognition events, principally insurance-oriented products. This review involves estimating the future profitability of in-force business and requires significant management judgment about assumptions including mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns, including net realized capital gains (losses). If actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses, we may be required to amortize any remaining DAC and record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense, which could negatively affect our results of operations. For example, realized gains on investment sales in 2013 and 2012 reduced future investment margins and required the recognition of additional liabilities for certain payout annuities. For further discussion of DAC and future policy benefits, see Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain of our products have guarantees that may increase the volatility of our results. We have annuity and life insurance products that guarantee a certain level of benefits, including guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB), guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV), and products with guaranteed interest crediting rates tied to an index. For GMDB, our most widely offered guaranteed benefit feature, the liabilities included in Future policyholder benefits were $401 million and $355 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our economic hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap contracts, as well as other hedging instruments, and is designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the GMWB and GMAV embedded derivative liabilities. The fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivatives included in Policyholder contract deposits was a net liability of $957 million at December 31, 2014 and a net asset of $37 million at December 31, 2013. Differences between the change in fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivatives and the hedging instruments can be caused by extreme and unanticipated movements in the equity markets, interest rates and market volatility, policyholder behavior and our inability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with the desired risk and return trade-off. While we believe that our actions have reduced the risks related to guaranteed benefits and guaranteed interest crediting, our exposure may not be fully hedged, and we may be liable if counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. We remain exposed to the risk that policyholder behavior and mortality may differ from our assumptions. Finally, while we believe the impact of downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility or reduced interest rates is offset by our economic hedging program, the occurrence of one or more of these events could result in an increase in the liabilities associated with the guaranteed benefits, reducing our net income and shareholders’ equity. See Notes 5 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates for more information regarding these products.\nIndemnity claims could be made against us in connection with divested businesses. We have provided financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the businesses we have sold, as described in greater detail in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we do not currently believe the claims under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significant indemnity claims could be made against us. If such a claim or claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these financial guarantees and indemnities.\nOur foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations. We provide insurance, investment and other financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 100 countries and jurisdictions. A substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, and we intend to continue to grow this business. Operations outside the United States may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect our other operations.\nThe degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. AIG subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses may require AIG Parent to meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country.\nItem 1A / risk factors\nWe may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. Although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution channels, we maintain relationships with certain key distributors. Distributors have in the past, and may in the future, elect to renegotiate the terms of existing relationships, or reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, including for such reasons as industry consolidation of distributors or other industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors, adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. An interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, when our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution, despite our training and compliance programs. If our products are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in any other inappropriate manner, we may suffer reputational and other harm to our business.\nOur ownership of a material amount of the common stock of, and our obligations to, AerCap exposes us to risks. As a result of the AerCap Transaction, we hold approximately 46 percent of the outstanding common stock of AerCap. As a result, declines in the value of AerCap’s common stock, and the other effects of our accounting for this investment under the equity method of accounting, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a reporting period.\nIn addition, in connection with the AerCap Transaction, AIG, AerCap, AerCap Ireland Limited, AerCap Ireland Capital Limited (AerCap Ireland) and certain subsidiaries of AerCap, as guarantors, entered into a credit agreement for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap Ireland, as borrower, and AIG, as lender and administrative agent (the AerCap Credit Facility). The AerCap Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment of $1.0 billion and permits loans for general corporate purposes. Depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings under the AerCap Credit Facility, an event of default under the AerCap Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are party to numerous legal proceedings, including securities class actions and regulatory and governmental investigations. Due to the nature of these proceedings, the lack of precise damage claims and the type of claims we are subject to, we cannot currently quantify our ultimate or maximum liability for these actions. Developments in these unresolved matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO) has brought suit against the United States challenging the government’s assistance of AIG, pursuant to which (i) AIG entered into a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and (ii) the United States received an approximately 80 percent ownership interest in AIG. The United States has alleged that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States for any recoveries in these lawsuits. A determination that the United States is liable for damages in such suits, together with a determination that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States for any such damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of the SICO litigation and other unresolved matters, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we are unable to maintain the availability of our electronic data systems and safeguard the security of our data, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer, employee, and company data and information. Some of these systems in turn, rely upon third-party systems. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. In the event of a natural disaster, a computer virus, unauthorized access, a terrorist attack or other disruption inside or outside the U.S., our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time, and our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. Our systems have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to unauthorized access, such as physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. There is no assurance that our security measures will provide fully effective security from such events. AIG maintains cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. In\nItem 1A / risk factors\nsome cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. Furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the European Union or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could result in remediation costs, legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.\nThe integration of companies we may acquire from time to time may not be as successful as we anticipate. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal and tax. Difficulties in integrating an acquired company may result in the acquired company performing differently than we expected or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions. Risks resulting from future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nREGULATION\nOur businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability. Our operations generally, and our insurance subsidiaries, in particular, are subject to extensive and potentially conflicting supervision and regulation by national authorities and by the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. State and foreign regulators also periodically review and investigate our insurance businesses, including AIG-specific and industry-wide practices. The primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of domestic regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments.\nWe strive to maintain all required licenses and approvals. However, our businesses may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations. The relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations also may change from time to time. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the required licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit them to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company.\nIn the U.S., the RBC formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Virtually every state has adopted, in substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which specifies the regulatory actions the insurance regulator may take if an insurer’s RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a plan describing how it would regain a specified RBC ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. Regulators at the federal and international levels are also considering the imposition of additional capital requirements on certain insurance companies, which may include us, that may augment or even displace state-law RBC standards that apply at the legal entity level, and such capital calculations may be made on bases other than the statutory statements of our insurance subsidiaries. See “Our status as a nonbank systemically important financial institution, as well as the enactment of Dodd-Frank, will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and cash flows” and “Actions by foreign governments and regulators could subject us to substantial additional regulation” below for additional information on increased capital requirements that may be imposed on us. We cannot predict the effect these initiatives may have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. AIG subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses may require AIG Parent to meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Accordingly, our insurance\nItem 1A / risk factors\nsubsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country.\nSee Item 1. Business - Regulation for further discussion of our regulatory environment.\nOur status as a nonbank systemically important financial institution, as well as the enactment of Dodd-Frank, will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and cash flows. On July 21, 2010, Dodd-Frank, which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years.\nWe cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted, the level and magnitude of supervision we may become subject to, or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible that the regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank and our regulation by the FRB as a nonbank SIFI could significantly alter our business practices, limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome and costly requirements and additional costs. Some of the regulations may also affect the perceptions of regulators, customers, counterparties, creditors or investors about our financial strength and could potentially affect our financing costs.\nSee Item 1. Business - Regulation for further discussion of the details of the aforementioned regulations to which AIG and its businesses are subject.\nActions by foreign governments and regulators could subject us to substantial additional regulation. We cannot predict the impact laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions may have on the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible such laws and regulations, the impact of our designation as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII) and certain initiatives by the FSB and the IAIS, including development of Basic Capital Requirements, Higher Loss Absorbency Capacity Requirements and an Insurance Capital Standard, and implementation of Solvency II in the European Union, may significantly alter our business practices, limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. It is possible that the laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions will differ from one another and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions including the United States.\nFor further details on these international regulations and their potential impact on AIG and its businesses, see Item 1. Business - Regulation-Other Regulatory Developments.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar laws that apply to us may expose us to significant penalties. The operations of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations, including, in some cases, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which require companies to know certain information about their clients and to monitor their transactions for suspicious activities. Also, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control administers regulations requiring U.S. persons to refrain from doing business, or allowing their clients to do business through them, with certain organizations or individuals on a prohibited list maintained by the U.S. government or with certain countries. The United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. Although we have instituted compliance programs to address these requirements, there are inherent risks in global transactions.\nAttempts to efficiently manage the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline AXXX may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The NAIC Model Regulation “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies” (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees. In addition, NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (AXXX) (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to certain universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees.\nOur domestic Life Insurance Companies manage the capital impact of statutory reserve requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX through affiliated reinsurance transactions, to maintain their ability to offer competitive pricing and successfully market such products. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on\nItem 1A / risk factors\nstatutory reserving requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX and our use of affiliated reinsurance. The NAIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services and other regulators have increased their focus on life insurers’ affiliated reinsurance transactions used to satisfy certain reserve requirements or to manage the capital impact of certain statutory reserve requirements, particularly transactions using captive insurance companies or special purpose vehicles. While our domestic Life Insurance Companies do not use captive or special purpose vehicle structures for this purpose, we cannot predict whether any applicable insurance laws will be changed in a way that prohibits or adversely impacts the use of affiliated reinsurance. If regulations change, we could be required to increase statutory reserves, increase prices on our products or incur higher expenses to obtain reinsurance, which could adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. If our actions to efficiently manage the impact of Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX on future sales of term and universal life insurance products are not successful, we may incur higher operating costs or our sales of these products may be affected.\nNew regulations promulgated from time to time may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively. Legislators and regulators may periodically consider various proposals that may affect the profitability of certain of our businesses. New regulations may even affect our ability to conduct certain businesses at all, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions. These proposals could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size, activities, geography, government support or other criteria). It is uncertain whether and how these and other such proposals would apply to us or our competitors or how they could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively.\nAn “ownership change” could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2014, we had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $33.0 billion and $7.1 billion in foreign tax credits (tax loss and credit carryforwards). Our ability to use such tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of AIG Parent's ownership (by value) of one or more “5-percent shareholders” (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382 would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an “ownership change”, it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss and credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.\nOn March 9, 2011, our Board adopted our Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) to help protect these tax loss and credit carryforwards, and on January 8, 2014, the Board adopted an amendment to the Plan, extending its expiration date to January 8, 2017. The amendment of the Plan was ratified by our shareholders at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At our 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders adopted a protective amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Protective Amendment), which is designed to prevent certain transfers of AIG Common Stock that could result in an “ownership change.” At our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to adopt a successor to the Protective Amendment that contains substantially the same terms as the Protective Amendment and that expires on May 12, 2017, the third anniversary of the date of our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nThe Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an “ownership change” by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of AIG Common Stock. The Protective Amendment generally restricts any transfer of AIG Common Stock that would (i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of AIG stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the percentage of AIG stock owned by a Five Percent Stockholder (as defined in the Plan). Despite the intentions of the Plan and the Protective Amendment to deter and prevent an “ownership change”, such an event may still occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of AIG Common Stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for AIG Common Stock. Accordingly, the Plan\nItem 1A / risk factors\nand the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder’s ability to realize a premium over the market price of AIG Common Stock in connection with any stock transaction.\nChanges in tax laws could increase our corporate taxes, reduce our deferred tax assets or make some of our products less attractive to consumers. Changes in tax laws or their interpretation could negatively impact our business or results. Some proposed changes could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate by reducing deductions or increasing income inclusions, such as by limiting rules allowing deferral of tax on certain foreign insurance income. Conversely, other changes, such as lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate discussed recently in the context of tax reform, could reduce the value of our deferred tax assets. In addition, changes in the way foreign taxes can be credited against U.S. taxes, methods for allocating interest expense, the ways insurance companies calculate and deduct reserves for tax purposes, and impositions of new or changed premium, value added and other indirect taxes could increase our tax expense, thereby reducing earnings.\nIn addition to proposing to change the taxation of corporations in general and insurance companies in particular, the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government and Congress have considered proposals that could increase taxes on owners of insurance products. For example, there have been proposals that would have limited the deferral of tax on income from life and annuity contracts relative to other investment products. These changes could reduce demand in the U.S. for life insurance and annuity contracts, or cause consumers to shift from these contracts to other investments, which would reduce our income due to lower sales of these products or potential increased surrenders of in-force business.\nThe need for governments to seek additional revenue makes it likely that there will be continued proposals to change tax rules in ways that would reduce our earnings. However, it remains difficult to predict whether or when there will be any tax law changes having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCOMPETITION and employees\nWe face intense competition in each of our businesses. Our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Our principal competitors are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks, investment banks and other nonbank financial institutions. The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the U.S., our Non-Life Insurance Companies compete with other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual insurance companies and other underwriting organizations. Our Life Insurance Companies compete in the U.S. with life insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, our subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies.\nThe past reduction of our credit ratings and past negative publicity have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business with existing customers and counterparties. General insurance and life insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. Retirement services companies compete through crediting rates and the issuance of guaranteed benefits. A decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.\nCompetition for employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability, we may be unable to hire or retain such employees. Losing any of our key people also could have a material adverse effect on our operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key employees.\nManaging key employee succession and retention is critical to our success. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.\nEmployee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses. There have been a number of cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and\nItem 1A / risk factors\nwe run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, misuse of customer or proprietary information, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the controls that we have in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nEstimates used in the preparation of financial statements and modeled results used in various areas of our business may differ materially from actual experience. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), which requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. The accounting policies that we consider most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore may be viewed as critical accounting estimates, are described in Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. These estimates are based on judgment, current facts and circumstances, and, when applicable, internally developed models. Therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we employ models to price products, calculate reserves and value assets, as well as evaluate risk and determine capital requirements, among other uses. These models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use incomplete, outdated or incorrect data or assumptions and may not operate properly. As our businesses continue to expand and evolve, the number and complexity of models we employ has grown, increasing our exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data, controls and assumptions and the controls we have in place to mitigate their risk may not be effective in all cases.\nChanges in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could impact our reported results of operations and our reported financial position. Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required to be implemented is disclosed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have ongoing projects to revise accounting standards for insurance contracts. The FASB has focused on disclosures for short-duration insurance contracts, which primarily relate to our property casualty products, and on targeted improvements to accounting measurements and disclosures for long-duration insurance contracts, which primarily relate to our life and annuity products. The IASB continues to contemplate significant changes to accounting measurements for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. While the final resolution of changes to U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards pursuant to these projects remains unclear, changes to the manner in which we account for insurance products could have a significant impact on our future financial reports, operations, capital management and business. Further, the adoption of a new insurance contracts standard as well as other future accounting standards could have a material effect on our reported results of operations and reported financial condition.\nChanges in our assumptions regarding the discount rate, expected rate of return, and expected compensation for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.",

The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon us vary from country to country and cannot be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, our policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of any affected assets. Certain of the countries in which our business is conducted have currency restrictions that generally cause a delay in a company’s ability to repatriate assets and profits. See also Item 1A.

On February 13, 2014, June 5, 2014 and October 31, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized increases to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of an aggregate of $4.5 billion.\nDuring the three-month period ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased approximately 27.9 million shares of AIG Common Stock under this authorization for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion.\nThe total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the three-month period ended December 31, 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of those shares, each as set forth above, reflect our payment of $1.4 billion under two ASR agreements executed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the receipt of approximately 22.2 million shares of AIG Common Stock, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 9.2 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR agreement executed in December 2014. That ASR agreement settled in January 2015, at which time we received approximately 3.5 million additional shares of AIG Common Stock based on a formula specified by the terms of the ASR Agreement. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the three-month period ended December 31, 2014 also includes (but the aggregate purchase price does not include) approximately 3.9 million shares of AIG Common Stock received in October 2014 upon the settlement of an ASR agreement executed in the third quarter of 2014.\nOn February 12, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $2.5 billion, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization on such date of approximately $2.5 billion. Shares may be repurchased from time to time under this authorization in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on AIG share purchases.\nItem 5 / market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities\ncommon Stock PERFORMANCE GRAPH\nThe following Performance Graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on AIG Common Stock for a five-year period (December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2014) with the cumulative total return of the S&P’s 500 stock index (which includes AIG) and a peer group of companies consisting of 15 insurance companies to which we compare our business and operations:\n• ACE Limited\n• Lincoln National Corporation\n• AEGON, N.V.\n• MetLife, Inc.\n• Aflac Incorporated\n• Principal Financial Group, Inc.\n• Allianz Group\n• Prudential Financial, Inc.\n• AXA Group\n• The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n• The Chubb Corporation\n• XL Capital Ltd.\n• CNA Financial Corporation\n• Zurich Insurance Group\n• The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\nItem 5 / market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities\nFive-Year Cumulative Total Shareholder Returns\nValue of $100 Invested on December 31, 2009\nDividend reinvestment has been assumed and returns have been weighted to reflect relative stock market capitalization.\nAs of December 31,\nAIG\n$\n100.00\n$\n192.19\n$\n94.28\n$\n143.45\n$\n208.29\n$\n230.67\nS&P 500\n100.00\n115.06\n117.49\n136.30\n180.44\n205.14\nPeer Group\n100.00\n108.02\n93.68\n120.29\n178.80\n180.92\nItem 6 / Selected financial data",

Other items that affected comparability are included in the footnotes to the table presented immediately above.\nAdjustments to Federal Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance\nWe concluded that $18.4 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the U.S. consolidated income tax group should be released through the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2011. The valuation allowance resulted primarily from losses subject to U.S. income taxes recorded from 2008 through 2010. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCapitalization and Book Value Per Share\nOn January 14, 2011, we completed a series of integrated transactions to recapitalize AIG (the Recapitalization) with the Department of the Treasury, the FRBNY and AIG Credit Facility Trust, including the repayment of all amounts owed under the Credit Facility with the FRBNY (the FRBNY Credit Facility). As a result of the closing of the Recapitalization on January 14, 2011, the remaining preferred interests (the SPV Preferred Interests) in the special purpose vehicles that held remaining AIA Group Limited (AIA) shares and the proceeds of the AIA initial public offering and the American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) sale (the AIA SPV and ALICO SPV, respectively) held by the FRBNY of approximately $26.4 billion were purchased by AIG and transferred to the Department of the Treasury. The SPV Preferred Interests were no longer considered permanent equity on AIG’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nItem 6 / Selected financial data\nThe following table presents pro forma ratios as if the Recapitalization had been consummated in 2010 and a reconciliation of book value per share to book value per share, excluding Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a non-GAAP measure.

These income tax items related to the creation in 2009 of special purpose vehicles that held our interests in AIA and ALICO. There was no effect on Total AIG shareholders’ equity or on Total equity as a result of this reclassification.\nFRBNY Activity and Effect on Interest Expense in 2010\nThe decline in interest expense in 2010 was due primarily to a reduced weighted-average interest rate on borrowings, a lower average outstanding balance and a decline in amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset related to the partial repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility. On January 14, 2011, AIG repaid the remaining $20.7 billion and terminated this facility, resulting in a net $3.3 billion pretax charge in the first quarter of 2011, representing primarily the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset included in Net loss on extinguishment of debt.\nAs a result of the closing of the Recapitalization on January 14, 2011, the SPV Preferred Interests in the special purpose vehicles that held remaining AIA shares and the proceeds of the AIA initial public offering and the ALICO sale (the SPVs) were transferred to the Department of the Treasury. After such closing, the SPV Preferred Interests were not considered permanent equity on AIG’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nAsset Dispositions in 2011 and 2014\nWe completed the sale of ILFC on May 14, 2014, as further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and executed multiple asset dispositions in 2011.",

(AIG) may from time to time make, projections, goals, assumptions and statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements include statements preceded by, followed by or including words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “view,” “target” or “estimate.” These projections, goals, assumptions and statements may address, among other things, our:\n• exposures to subprime mortgages, monoline insurers, the residential and commercial real estate markets, state and municipal bond issuers, sovereign bond issuers, the energy sector and currency exchange rates;\n• exposure to European governments and European financial institutions;\n• strategy for risk management;\n• generation of deployable capital;\n• return on equity and earnings per share;\n• strategies to grow net investment income, efficiently manage capital and reduce expenses;\n• strategies for customer retention, growth, product development, market position, financial results and reserves; and\n• the revenues and combined ratios of our subsidiaries.\nIt is possible that our actual results and financial condition will differ, possibly materially, from the results and financial condition indicated in these projections, goals, assumptions and statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the specific projections, goals, assumptions and statements include:\n• changes in market conditions;\n• the occurrence of catastrophic events, both natural and man-made;\n• significant legal proceedings;\n• the timing and applicable requirements of any new regulatory framework to which we are subject as a nonbank systemically important financial institution (SIFI) and as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII);\n• concentrations in our investment portfolios;\n• actions by credit rating agencies;\n• judgments concerning casualty insurance underwriting and insurance liabilities;\n• judgments concerning the recognition of deferred tax assets; and\n• such other factors discussed in:\n• Part I, Item 1A.

Selected Financial Data and throughout this MD&A, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results. Some of the measurements we use are “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.” The non-GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.\nBook Value Per Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments. Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nWe use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A on a consolidated basis.\nAfter-tax operating income attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income attributable to AIG:\n• deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;\n• changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense);\n• changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses;\n• other income and expense - net, related to Corporate and Other run-off insurance lines;\n• loss on extinguishment of debt;\n• net realized capital gains and losses;\n• non-qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital gains and losses;\n• income or loss from discontinued operations;\n• income and loss from divested businesses, including:\n• gain on the sale of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC); and\n• certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap) in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and related tax effects;\n• legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments; and\n• legal reserves and settlements related to legacy crisis matters, which include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters.\nItem 7 / use of non-gaap measures\nWe use the following operating performance measures within our Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reportable segments as well as Corporate and Other.\n• Commercial Insurance: Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty; Consumer Insurance: Personal Insurance\n· Pre-tax operating income: includes both underwriting income and loss and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital gains and losses, other income and expense - net and legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above. Underwriting income and loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses and general operating expenses.\n· Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n· Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact in excess of $10 million each.\n· Commercial Insurance: Institutional Markets; Consumer Insurance: Retirement and Life\n· Pre-tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from pre-tax income:\n• changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense);\n• changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains and losses; and\n• net realized capital gains and losses;\n• legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above.\n· Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds.\n· Corporate and Other - Pre-tax operating income and loss is derived by excluding the following items from pre-tax income and loss:\n• loss on extinguishment of debt;\n• net realized capital gains and losses;\n• changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains and losses;\n• income and loss from divested businesses, including Aircraft Leasing;\n• net gain or loss on sale of divested businesses, including:\n· gain on the sale of ILFC; and\n· certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and our share of AerCap’s income taxes; and\n• certain legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters described above.\nResults from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nExecutive Overview\nThis overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG’s securities. You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed our previously announced reorganization of our commercial and consumer insurance businesses and modified the presentation of our results to reflect our new operating structure. The new operating structure includes two reportable segments, Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, and a Corporate and Other category. The Corporate and Other category consists of businesses and items not allocated to our reportable segments. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported our results through two reportable segments - AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement.\nIn order to align financial reporting with the manner in which our chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reportable segments include the following operating segments:\n• Commercial property casualty, mortgage guaranty and institutional markets businesses, which were previously reported as components of AIG Property Casualty, Other operations and AIG Life and Retirement, respectively, are now reported as components of the Commercial Insurance reportable segment.\n• Consumer property casualty business and Japan life insurance business, which were previously reported as components of AIG Property Casualty, and our retail life and retirement and institutional group retirement and group benefits businesses, which were previously reported as components of AIG Life and Retirement, are now reported as components of the Consumer Insurance reportable segment.\n• Insurance run-off lines of business, which were previously reported in AIG Property Casualty's Other category, are now reported as a component of the Corporate and Other category.\nPrior periods have been revised to conform to the current period presentation for the above segment changes.\nPresentation Changes\nWe reclassified our presentation for certain Policy fees, along with a related portion of Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, from their respective captions to Net realized capital gains (losses) and Changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses), respectively. The reclassification of these policy fees, which are related primarily to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) embedded derivatives in our variable annuity products, to realized capital gains (losses), consolidates the fees from these embedded derivatives with the associated change in fair value of such derivatives. The reclassifications reduced pre-tax operating income and after-tax operating income, but had no effect on GAAP basis Total revenues, Income from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) or Net income.\nAlso, revisions were made to change the classification of certain miscellaneous income from General operating and other expenses to premiums, and of certain broker-dealer fees from General operating and other expenses to other income, to conform with the current period presentation. There was no effect on pre-tax or after-tax operating income, income from continuing operations or net income.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nThe reclassifications and revisions affected previously reported captions as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nAs\nAs\nAs\nAs\nPreviously\nIncrease\nCurrently\nPreviously\nIncrease\nCurrently\nReported\n(Decrease)\nReported\nReported\n(Decrease)\nReported\nPremiums\n$\n37,350\n$\n$\n37,499\n$\n38,047\n$\n$\n38,189\nPolicy fees\n2,535\n(195)\n2,340\n2,349\n(157)\n2,192\nNet realized capital gains (losses)\n1,744\n1,939\n1,087\nOther income\n6,819\n6,866\n4,848\n4,899\nTotal\n48,448\n-\n48,644\n46,174\n46,367\nGeneral operating and other expenses\n13,368\n13,564\n12,820\n13,013\nNet income attributable to AIG\n9,085\n-\n9,085\n3,438\n-\n3,438\nPre-tax operating income\n9,561\n(171)\n9,390\n10,082\n(144)\n9,938\nAfter-tax operating income\n6,762\n(112)\n6,650\n6,635\n(93)\n6,542\nExecutive Summary\nFinancial Performance\nCommercial Insurance pre-tax operating income increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to improved underwriting results in the Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty operating segments partially offset by reduced net investment income in the Property Casualty and Institutional Markets operating segments.\nConsumer Insurance pre-tax operating income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower net investment income, primarily from lower income from alternative investments, and additional reserves for IBNR death claims related to continued enhancement of claims procedures. These items more than offset favorable performance from our businesses in 2014 compared to 2013, which included growth in policy fees and assets under management primarily from strong sales of variable and index annuities in Retirement, effective crediting rate management, and higher underwriting income in Personal Insurance, primarily from improved loss experience and lower general operating expenses.\nOur investment portfolio performance improved in 2014 compared to 2013 due to positive performance on bonds for which we elected the fair value option, driven by movements on interest rates.\nNet realized capital gains declined in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower capital gains from sales of investments related to capital loss carryforward utilization and higher fair value losses on embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges.\nOur Performance - Selected Indicators\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except per share data and ratios)\nResults of operations data:\nTotal revenues\n$\n64,406\n$\n68,874\n$\n71,214\nIncome from continuing operations\n7,574\n9,008\n3,699\nNet income attributable to AIG\n7,529\n9,085\n3,438\nNet income per common share attributable to AIG (diluted)\n5.20\n6.13\n2.04\nAfter-tax operating income attributable to AIG\n6,630\n6,650\n6,542\nAfter-tax operating income per common share attributable\nto AIG (diluted)\n4.58\n4.49\n3.88\nKey metrics:\nCommercial Insurance\nProperty Casualty combined ratio\n100.2\n101.6\n110.9\nProperty Casualty accident year combined ratio, as adjusted\n94.2\n95.1\n99.3\nProperty Casualty net premiums written\n$\n21,020\n$\n20,880\n$\n20,348\nMortgage Guaranty domestic first-lien new insurance written\n42,038\n49,356\n37,273\nInstitutional Markets premiums and deposits\n3,797\nConsumer Insurance\nPersonal Insurance combined ratio\n99.9\n101.5\n102.1\nPersonal Insurance accident year combined ratio, as adjusted\n99.5\n102.1\n99.3\nPersonal Insurance net premiums written\n$\n12,412\n$\n12,700\n$\n13,302\nRetirement premiums and deposits\n24,023\n23,729\n16,048\nLife premiums and deposits\n4,806\n4,862\n4,864\nLife Insurance Companies assets under management\n332,847\n317,977\n290,387\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except per share data)\nBalance sheet data:\nTotal assets\n$\n515,581\n$\n541,329\nLong-term debt\n31,217\n41,693\nTotal AIG shareholders’ equity\n106,898\n100,470\nBook value per common share\n77.69\n68.62\nBook value per common share, excluding AOCI\n69.98\n64.28\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nTotal revenues\n(in millions)\nIncome from continuing operations\n(in millions)\nNet income ATTRIBUTABLE TO AIG\n(in millions)\nNet INCOME PER COMMON SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO AIG (DILUTED)\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nAfter-tax operating income attributable to aig (excludes net realized capital gains and certain other items)\n(in millions)\nPre-tax operating income by segment\n(in millions)\nTOTAL ASSETS\n(in millions)\nLong-term debt\n(in millions)\nTotal AIG shareholders’ equity\n(in millions)\nBook value per common share and book value per common share excluding aoci\n* Includes operating borrowings of other subsidiaries and consolidated investments and hybrid debt securities.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nInvestment Highlights\nNet investment income increased 1.7 percent to $16.1 billion in 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet investment income improved in 2014 compared to 2013 due to positive performance on bonds for which we elected the fair value option, driven by interest rate movements. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed income securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.\nNet unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 from approximately $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 due to a decline in interest rates and widening of spreads.\nThe overall credit rating of our fixed maturity securities portfolio remains largely unchanged from December 31, 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Highlights\nWe reduced our debt in 2014 as a result of maturities, repayments and repurchases of $16.1 billion, of which $7.5 billion is related to DIB redemptions and repurchases.\nWe maintained financial flexibility at AIG Parent in 2014 through $2.6 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Non-Life Insurance Companies and $6.8 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies, which included approximately $829 million of legal settlement proceeds.\nOur Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), by an additional $2.5 billion on February 12, 2015. During 2014, we repurchased approximately 88 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of these shares, reflect our payment of approximately $3.1 billion in the aggregate under five accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreements and our receipt of approximately 53 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 9.2 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR Agreement executed in December 2014.\nWe paid a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share on each of March 25, 2014, June 24, 2014, September 25, 2014 and December 18, 2014.\nOur Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock on February 12, 2015 of $0.125 per share, payable on March 26, 2015 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2015.\nWe received net cash proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion from the sale of ILFC after taking into account the settlement of intercompany loans. This cash amount is in addition to the 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares we received as consideration from the sale.\nAdditional discussion and other liquidity and capital resources developments are included in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources herein.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nStrategic Outlook\nIndustry Trends\nOur business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2014, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global markets and slowing growth in emerging markets, China and Euro-Zone economies.\nInterest rates remain low relative to historical levels, which has affected our industry by reducing investment returns. In addition, current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines.\nAIG Priorities for 2015\nAIG is focused on the following priorities for 2015:\n· Improve our focus on our customers to understand their challenges and to help solve their problems;\n· Improve our cost structure to simplify our operations in ways that bring us closer to our customers;\n· Improve our technology infrastructure to better serve customers and distribution partners, increase productivity, reduce expenses, and better position ourselves against our competitors; and\n· Concentrate on activities that increase our intrinsic value and sustainable profitability.\nOutlook for Our Operating Businesses\nThe outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2015 and over the longer term is summarized below.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nCommercial insurance Strategic initiatives and Outlook\nExecutive Overview\nCustomer - Strive to be our customers’ most valued insurer by offering innovative products, superior service and access to an extensive global network.\nStrategic Growth - Grow our higher-value businesses while investing in transformative opportunities.\nUnderwriting Excellence -Improve our business portfolio through better pricing and risk selection by using enhanced data, analytics and the application of science to deliver superior risk adjusted returns.\nClaims Excellence - Improve claims processes, analytics and tools to deliver superior customer service and decrease our loss ratio.\nOperational Effectiveness -Continue initiatives to modernize our technology and infrastructure; implement best practices to improve speed and quality of service.\nCapital Efficiency - Increase capital fungibility and diversification, streamline our legal entity structure, optimize reinsurance and improve tax efficiency.\nInvestment Strategy - Increase asset diversification and take advantage of yield enhancement opportunities to meet our capital, liquidity, risk and return objectives.\nMarket Conditions and Industry Trends\nCommercial Insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels, currency volatility, and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets. Due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, Commercial Insurance has sought to modify terms and conditions, grow profitable segments of the business, exit unprofitable businesses and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability.\nProperty Casualty\nProperty Casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges. In recent years, Property Casualty has benefitted from favorable pricing trends, particularly in the U.S. However, such trends have tapered off in recent quarters. The property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets. Property Casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries, although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions.\nSince the second quarter of 2014, within the U.S. commercial property business, Property Casualty observed continued rate pressure in the U.S. Excess and Surplus lines market, particularly with respect to its natural catastrophe exposed business. Property Casualty continues to differentiate its capacity from its peers through leveraging management’s significant experience with catastrophic events, providing loss prevention expertise and maintaining discipline in pricing to internal targets despite intense competition.\nIn the U.S., Property Casualty’s exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. For additional information on TRIA, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures and Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management - Insurance Operations Risks - Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks - Terrorism Risk.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nMortgage Guaranty\nWhile higher residential mortgage interest rates have had an unfavorable impact on new mortgage loan volumes, particularly on refinancing activity, Mortgage Guaranty expects current residential mortgage interest rates will have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written in 2012 and 2013, since refinancing of mortgages would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the historically low residential mortgage interest rates prevalent during that period. Mortgage Guaranty expects that this higher persistency will continue to have a positive effect on its results throughout 2015.\nMortgage Guaranty also expects that newly reported delinquencies will decline during 2015. Mortgage Guaranty believes the combination of higher persistency and lower new delinquencies, partially offset by a decline in new mortgage loan volumes, will result in favorable operating results for 2015.\nInstitutional Markets\nInstitutional Markets is expected to continue growing its assets under management from increased stable value wrap business, as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to pension buyouts and GICs.\nStrategic Initiatives\nCustomer\nCommercial Insurance strives to be our customers’ most valued insurer. Our investments in engineering, underwriting, claims services, science and data together are intended to help offer our customers not only innovative products, superb service and access to an extensive global network but also a superior and rewarding customer experience.\nStrategic Growth\nProperty Casualty’s efforts to better segment its business by industry, geography and type of coverage in order to enhance its decision making regarding risk acceptance and pricing are ongoing. For example, within workers’ compensation, Property Casualty has observed different experience and trends based on this segmentation, which helps inform its risk appetite, pricing and loss mitigation decisions.\nMortgage Guaranty expects to continue as a leading provider of mortgage insurance and seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by utilizing its proprietary risk-based pricing strategy. This pricing strategy provides Mortgage Guaranty’s customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with the underwriting risk, which we believe will result in an appropriately priced, high-quality book of business.\nInstitutional Markets is expected to continue contributing to growth in assets under management with stable value wraps and utilizing a disciplined approach to growth and diversification of our business by pursuing select opportunities in areas such as the pension buyout business.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nUnderwriting Excellence\nWe continue to further enhance our risk selection process and refine technical pricing and producer management, through enhanced tools and analytics. In addition, we remain focused on managing exposure to capital intensive long-tail lines. We believe that accident year loss ratios, as adjusted, will continue to improve due to these actions.\nClaims Excellence\nWe continue to reduce loss costs by realizing greater efficiencies in servicing customer claims, introducing improved claims analytics and services, developing knowledge of the economic drivers of losses which collectively are expected to mitigate reserve development and legal costs, and improve customer insights and pricing.\nOperational Effectiveness\nWe continue to make strategic investments in systems, processes and talent worldwide, which are expected to create additional value and greater efficiency in the years ahead. In addition, along with other areas of AIG, Commercial Insurance continues to leverage its various off-shore centers, taking advantage of opportunities to centralize and standardize processes and platforms.\nCapital Efficiency\nCommercial Insurance continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad-based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. In addition, Commercial Insurance remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency, although this strategy may lead to periodic income statement volatility.\nWe also continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency for regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency, particularly with respect to the Non-Life Insurance Companies in the Property Casualty and Personal Insurance operating segments. Our legal entity restructuring initiatives have enhanced dividend capacity, reduced required capital, and provided tax benefits for these operations. Additionally, the restructurings allow us to simplify our reinsurance arrangements, which further facilitate increased capital optimization. In 2014, we completed the integration of our Japan operations into a holding company structure through the conversion of the American Home Assurance Company’s Japan branch to a subsidiary of the Japan holding company, American Home Assurance Japan, effective on April 1, 2014. We expect our overall legal entity restructuring to be substantially completed in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nconsumer insurance STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND Outlook\nStrategic Initiatives\nCustomer: Strive to be our customers’ most valued insurer. Through our unique franchise, which brings together a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and personal insurance products offered through multiple distribution networks, Consumer Insurance aims to provide customers with the products they need, delivered through the channels they prefer.\nInformation-driven Strategy: Utilize customer insight, analytics and the application of science to optimize customer acquisition, product profitability, product mix, channel performance and risk management capabilities.\nFocused Growth: Invest in areas where Consumer Insurance can grow profitably and sustainably. Target growth in select markets according to market size, growth potential, market maturity and customer demographics.\nOperational Effectiveness: Simplify processes, enhance operating environments, and leverage the best platforms and tools for multiple operating segments to increase competitiveness, improve service and product capabilities and facilitate delivery of our target customer experience.\nInvestment Strategy: Maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that largely matches the duration characteristics of related insurance liabilities with assets of comparable duration, and pursue yield-enhancement opportunities that meet liquidity, risk and return objectives.\nProfitability and Capital Management: Deliver solid earnings through disciplined pricing, sustainable underwriting improvements and diversification of risk, and increase capital efficiency within insurance entities to enhance return on equity.\nMarket Conditions and Industry Trends\nRetirement\nAn increasing population of Americans expecting to live longer and placing less reliance on traditional retirement benefits are seeking financial security as they approach retirement, which continues to drive demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features. In addition, rising tax rates and a desire for higher investment returns have prompted less risk-averse investors to seek products without guaranteed lifetime income, providing Retirement Income Solutions the opportunity to further diversify its product portfolio by offering investment-focused variable annuities.\nThe sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. As long as the sustained low interest rate environment continues, market conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. In addition, more highly leveraged providers have entered the market offering higher crediting rates.\nDespite the challenging environment where long-term interest rates have continued to remain low relative to historical levels throughout 2014, fixed annuity industry sales have continued to improve from the very low levels seen in 2013, as baby boomers approaching retirement continue to seek financial solutions that can provide guaranteed income, and customers are now more willing to purchase non-guaranteed return of premium products with market value adjustments in exchange for higher crediting rates. Although rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased surrenders, customers are currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nLife\nPopulations are living longer and have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries, estate planning and wealth creation. The Life operating segment addresses these needs with a broad spectrum of products, ranging from the pure protection focus of term life to investment-oriented products such as indexed and variable universal life.\nU.S. life insurance industry sales declined in 2014, driven by lower term and universal life sales partially offset by small gains in whole life markets. Market factors, primarily low interest rates and regulatory changes, have caused the universal life market to shift its focus from guaranteed universal life to indexed universal life products that offer attractive cash accumulation and increased living benefit options.\nPersonal Insurance\nThe overall rate level has improved in the Japanese and certain U.S. markets for auto, personal property, and accident and health products compared to prior years. In Japan, car and home sales increased in 2014 prior to the increase in the consumption tax, but prospectively, sales are expected to return to normal levels. In the U.S., overall rate level changes for auto and personal property products are expected to be positive but slow, with sales increasing as the economy continues to recover. Our Personal Insurance operating segment expects to increase its investment in growth economy nations that have a higher growth outlook for personal insurance products.\nStrategic Initiatives\nCustomer\nWe intend to expand relationships with key distribution partners to fully realize the benefits of our diverse product offerings across multiple channels. Our focus on ease of doing business for consumers and producers includes enhancements to our platforms and services, as well as initiatives to improve the recruitment, training and productivity of our affiliated and non-affiliated distribution partners.\nInformation-driven Strategy\nWe intend to continue to strengthen our direct marketing capabilities through the use of analytics, stronger platforms and tools, an enhanced product portfolio and expanded relationships allowing us to bring more product solutions to our target markets.\nWe intend to achieve rate adequacy through implementation of global underwriting practices and enhanced tools and analytics. We intend to optimize the value of our business lines through product and portfolio management and refined technical pricing. We intend to continue to enhance the customer experience and efficiency through claim best practices, and to deploy enhanced operating structures and standardized processes and systems, while managing claim-handling efficiency.\nFocused Growth\nRetirement Income Solutions intends to continue capitalizing on the opportunity to meet consumer demand for guaranteed income by maintaining competitive variable annuity product offerings while managing risk, using innovative product design and well-developed economic hedging capabilities. De-risking features of its variable annuity product design include variable rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts, and the utilization of volatility control funds. Retirement Income Solutions has a dynamic risk management hedging program and continues to invest in market risk management. Strategies to diversify the Retirement Income Solutions product portfolio include growing sales of fixed index annuities with guarantee features, which provide additional income solutions for consumers approaching retirement, and introducing new investment-focused variable annuities, which offer alternative asset classes and tax benefits to investors seeking higher returns without guaranteed lifetime income.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nFixed Annuities sales will continue to be challenged by the low interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities could improve if interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens, as these market conditions make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits. The growing market for immediate and deferred income products, driven by customers seeking guaranteed income products, provides an opportunity for Fixed Annuities to increase the diversification of its product portfolio.\nLife will continue to invest to position for growth and serve its customers more effectively, and maintain pricing discipline in its overall strategy. Internationally, Life intends to expand its business in Japan, the United Kingdom and certain other countries through a focused strategy in selected markets and products by combining global expertise with local market intelligence to meet the needs of consumers in these target markets.\nWe acquired Ageas Protect Limited (Ageas Protect) on December 31, 2014 from international insurer Ageas Group for approximately $308 million. Our agreement to acquire Ageas Protect was announced in August 2014. Ageas Protect is a leading provider of life protection products in the United Kingdom, recognized in its market for product innovation, the effective use of technology and high quality service. We expect the acquisition of Ageas Protect to enhance our global Consumer Insurance business and strengthen our presence in the United Kingdom, where we already offer personal accident, health and travel insurance coverage, as well as customized insurance solutions for high net worth individuals through AIG Private Client Group.\nAs part of our strategy to expand consumer operations in growth economies, on May 29, 2013, we entered into a joint venture agreement with PICC Life Insurance Company Limited (PICC Life), a subsidiary of the PICC Group, to form an agency distribution company in China to distribute life and retirement products. The joint venture company distributes PICC Life products and PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) insurance products, as well as other products aimed at meeting the needs of this developing market, and will distribute jointly developed life, retirement and personal insurance products. We own 24.9 percent of the joint venture company and PICC Life holds the remaining 75.1 percent. The joint venture commenced operations in March 2014.\nConsumer Insurance continues to explore other potential life insurance and accident and health opportunities internationally.\nPersonal Insurance aims to provide customers with the products they need, distributed through the channels they prefer, and delivered with excellent customer service. Personal Insurance is focused on profitable growth in its selected market segments, with targeted investments in both scale businesses and emerging markets. Personal Insurance will continue to leverage its strong risk management and market expertise to foster growth by providing innovative and competitive solutions to its customers and distributors.\nOperational Effectiveness\nWe are continuing to invest in initiatives to enable simpler and more agile low-cost operating models to provide superior service and position our operating platforms to accommodate significant future growth. In Japan, we continue to invest in technology and systems to improve operating efficiency and make it easier for our partners and our customers to do business with us, with the intent to ultimately increase our market share and facilitate our expansion in segments of the market that are expected to grow over the next decade, given demographic trends. In the U.S. Life business, we are focused on leveraging our most efficient systems environments and increased automation of our underwriting process. We believe that these simpler operating models will allow for productivity improvements and enhance our ability to leverage common functionality across product lines and borders, further supporting profitable growth.\nInvestment Strategy\nOur investment objective is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities having weighted average durations that are matched to the duration and cash flow profile of our liabilities, to the extent practicable. Our investment strategy is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability matching and available investment opportunities. See Investments for additional discussion of investment strategies.\nItem 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nProfitability and Capital Management\nWe intend to continue to enhance profitability and capital efficiency within our insurance entities through disciplined pricing, in-force profitability management and effective management of risk. Volatility risk controls including required minimum allocations to fixed and volatility control accounts, rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index and our comprehensive dynamic hedging program are critical tools for products where we have significant equity market risk and exposure to changes in interest rates. Additionally, our scale and the breadth of our product offerings provide diversification of risk. Within our Non-Life Insurance Companies, we continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital efficiency.\nSee Results of Operations - Segment Results - Consumer Insurance Results and Insurance Reserves for additional information.\nItem 7 / Results of Operations\nResults of Operations\nThe following section provides a comparative discussion of our Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three-year period ended December 31, 2014. Factors that relate primarily to a specific business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment discussion.

The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $236 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $209 million related to a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $182 million of income excludable from gross income related to the global resolution of certain residential mortgage-related disputes and $68 million associated with the effect of foreign operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 3.8 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $2.8 billion related to a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $396 million related to a decrease in certain other valuation allowances associated with foreign jurisdictions and $298 million associated with tax exempt interest income. These items were partially offset by charges of $632 million related to uncertain tax positions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2012, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was (27.9) percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to decreases in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance of $1.9 billion related to the actual and projected gains from the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ available-for-sale securities, and tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income of $302 million. These items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions of $446 million.\nItem 7 / Results of Operations\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to AIG to after-tax operating income attributable to AIG:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nNet income attributable to AIG\n$\n7,529\n$\n9,085\n$\n3,438\nUncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments\nDeferred income tax valuation allowance releases\n(181)\n(3,237)\n(1,911)\nChanges in fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living\nbenefit liabilities, net of interest expense\n(169)\n(24)\nChanges in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA\nrelated to net realized capital gains (losses)\n1,148\nOther (income) expense - net\n-\n-\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n1,483\nNet realized capital gains\n(470)\n(1,285)\n(687)\n(Income) loss from discontinued operations\n(84)\n(1)\n(Income) loss from divested businesses, including gain on the sale of ILFC\n(1,462)\n4,039\nLegal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters\n(350)\n(460)\nNon-qualifying derivative hedging (gains) losses, excluding net realized capital\ngains\n-\n-\n(18)\nAfter-tax operating income attributable to AIG\n$\n6,630\n$\n6,650\n$\n6,542\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding\n1,447,553,652\n1,481,206,797\n1,687,226,641\nIncome per common share attributable to AIG (diluted)\n$\n5.20\n$\n6.13\n$\n2.04\nAfter-tax operating income per common share attributable\nto AIG (diluted)\n$\n4.58\n$\n4.49\n$\n3.88\nAfter-tax operating income attributable to AIG for 2014 was essentially flat compared to 2013, primarily due to higher income tax expense, partially offset by an increase in income from insurance operations.\nAfter-tax operating income attributable to AIG increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to increases in income from insurance operations, lower income tax expense and noncontrolling interests, partially offset by fair value gains on AIG’s previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares, Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II), and ML III.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 30.9 percent. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 28.8 percent. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 31.6 percent. The difference from the statutory rate was primarily due to tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items.\nItem 7 / Results of Operations\nSegment Results\nWe report the results of our operations through two reportable segments: Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance.

As these expenses, which total $263 million, are related to an overall AIG initiative to centralize work streams into lower cost locations, and create a more streamlined organization, they have not been allocated to the operating segments.\npre-tax operating INCOME\n(in millions)\ncommercial insurance\nconsumer insurance\nItem 7 / Results of Operations\nPre-tax Income Comparison for 2014 and 2013\nPre-tax income increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax operating income for Commercial Insurance, a $2.3 billion increase in income from divested businesses associated with the gain recognized upon completion of the sale of ILFC in 2014 and lower loss recognition expense reported in changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital gains. These increases were partially offset by higher loss on extinguishment of debt from on-going debt management activities, a decrease in net realized capital gains driven by lower gains from sales of investments related to capital loss carryforward utilization in 2013, and a decrease in legal settlements with financial institutions that participated in the creation, offering and sale of RMBS from which we realized losses during the financial crisis.\nThe change in the fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded policy derivatives, net of the change in fair value of all related economic hedges, resulted in a $149 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2014, we reduced our exposure to interest rate changes and consequently, the increase in the embedded policy derivative liability in 2014 was largely offset by the change in the fair value of related hedges. In 2013, pre-tax income increased due to the decrease in the embedded policy derivative liability driven by an increase in interest rates, which was only partially offset by hedging. The changes in fair value of the embedded policy derivatives and the majority of the related economic hedges are reported in Net realized gains (losses), and the change in fair value of certain U.S. Treasury bonds which hedge interest rate risk are reported in Change in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities.\nThe increase in pre-tax income in 2014 compared to 2013 included an increase due to lower changes in certain benefit reserves, DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains, which was primarily comprised of loss recognition expense in the Institutional Markets and Retirement operating segments, totaling $30 million in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013, attributable primarily to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization with reinvestment of the sales proceeds at lower yields. Changes in certain benefit reserves, DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains also included loss recognition expense in Corporate and Other of $140 million in 2014 and $98 million in 2013.\nPre-tax Income Comparison for 2013 and 2012\nPre-tax income increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax operating income for both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, a $6.7 billion increase due to the loss associated with the announced sale of ILFC in 2012, an increase in legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters and an increase in net realized capital gains, driven by gains from sales of investments related to capital loss carryforward utilization in 2013, partially offset by impairments on investments in life settlements, an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt from on-going debt management activities and higher loss recognition expense reported in changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital gains.\nThe aggregate change in the fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded policy derivatives net of the change in fair value of all related economic hedges, reported within Net realized capital gains (losses) and Change in fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, resulted in a $719 million increase in pre-tax income in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the increase in interest rates.\nChange in certain benefit reserves, DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains was largely comprised of loss recognition expense in the Institutional Markets and Retirement operating segments, totaling $1.5 billion in 2013 and $1.2 billion in 2012, that was attributable primarily to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization with reinvestment of the sales proceeds at lower yields. Change in certain benefit reserves, DAC, VOBA and SIA also included loss recognition expense in Corporate and Other of $98 million in 2013.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income is attributed to the operating segments of Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.\nItem 7 / Results of Operations\nFor Commercial Insurance - Property Casualty and Consumer Insurance - Personal Insurance, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premiums and a capital allocation for each operating segment. The net investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus a liquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities, and excludes net investment income associated with the run-off insurance lines reported in Corporate and Other. The remaining excess is attributed to Commercial Insurance - Property Casualty and Consumer Insurance - Personal Insurance based on the relative net investment income previously allocated.\nFor Commercial Insurance - Institutional Markets, Consumer Insurance - Retirement and Consumer Insurance - Life, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios. Invested assets in excess of liabilities are allocated to product lines based on internal capital estimates.\nProperty Casualty, International Life and Personal Insurance's business is transacted in most major foreign currencies.

The decrease in underwriting loss was primarily due to an increase in production, lower charges due to changes in discount for workers’ compensation reserves as discussed further under Insurance Reserves - Non-Life Insurance Companies- Discounting of Reserves, lower catastrophe losses and lower general operating expenses. The loss reserve discount charge decreased to $71 million in 2014 from $322 million in 2013. Catastrophe losses decreased to $602 million in 2014 from $710 million in 2013. These decreases were partially offset by higher adverse prior year loss reserve development in all lines of business except for Property, and an increase in current accident year losses reflecting higher frequency of non-severe losses in the Property and Specialty businesses. The current accident year losses for 2014 included 30 severe losses totaling $592 million compared to 27 severe losses totaling $569 million in the prior year. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including related premium adjustments, was $550 million and $294 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, as discussed further under Insurance Reserves - Non-Life Insurance Companies - Net Loss Development.\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nAcquisition expenses decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a reduction in expenses related to personnel engaged in sales support activities, and lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments reflecting a change in business mix.\nGeneral operating expenses decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives, partially offset by higher technology-related expenses and an increase in bad debt expense. In the prior year, general operating expenses benefitted from an unusually low bad debt expense.\nNet investment income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates during 2014, as yields on new purchases were lower than the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio, lower income on alternative investments, and lower income associated with investments accounted for under the fair value option, as the increase related to the PICC P&C rights offerings was more than offset by a decrease from fixed maturity investments accounted for under the fair value option. These were partially offset by the effect of continued portfolio diversification. Additionally, the decrease in allocated net investment income is also due to a reduction in net loss reserves.\nSee MD&A - Investments for additional information on the Non-Life Insurance Companies invested assets, investment strategy, and asset-liability management process.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to a lower underwriting loss as a result of lower catastrophe losses, rate increases, enhanced risk selection and loss mitigation activities and an increase in net investment income. Catastrophe losses decreased to $710 million in 2013 from $2.3 billion in 2012. Partially offsetting these improvements was a loss reserve discount charge of $322 million in 2013, compared to a $100 million benefit in 2012. See Insurance Reserves- Non-Life Insurance Companies- Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. In addition, the current accident year losses for 2013 included severe losses of $569 million compared to $293 million in 2012. This increase was driven largely by a large property loss and related contingent business interruption claims, totaling $131 million in 2013 and by an increased frequency of severe losses in 2013 compared to 2012. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development increased by $30 million compared to 2012. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including related premium adjustments was $294 million in 2013, which included $149 million of adverse prior year loss reserve development related to Storm Sandy, compared to $236 million in 2012. The adverse prior year loss reserve development related to Storm Sandy resulted from higher severities on a small number of existing large and complex commercial claims. These increased severities were driven by a number of factors, including the extensive damage caused to properties in the downtown New York metropolitan area.\nAcquisition expenses decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to changes in reinsurance, the timing of guaranty funds and other assessments, as well as change in business mix.\nGeneral operating expenses decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense and reduced costs for strategic initiatives. Bad debt expense decreased by $159 million in 2013 from $140 million in 2012. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily due to reductions in prior year reserves, as collections exceeded the originally estimated recoveries. Strategic initiatives which include technology-related expenses and those severance charges borne by Property Casualty, decreased by $137 million in 2013 from $277 million in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the cost of employee incentive plans primarily due to an improved alignment of employee performance with the overall performance of the organization, including our stock performance, and accelerated vesting provisions for retirement-eligible individuals in the 2013 share-based plan.\nNet investment income increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to increased alternative investment income derived from equity market performance and income associated with the PICC P&C shares that are accounted for under the fair value option. This alternative investment performance was primarily due to our investments in hedge funds, which benefited from equity market performance. Fair value increases also contributed to the net investment income increase. The portion of our investment in PICC P&C shares accounted for under the fair value option contributed $110 million to net investment income. Although interest rates remained at historically low levels, there were upward movements in rates throughout the year, with the ten year U.S. Treasury yield increasing 126 basis points during 2013. These increasing rates, coupled with continued portfolio diversification, helped mitigate the effects of interest rates on matured or sold investments\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nexceeding new investment yields. The combination of improving yield differential and above average alternative investment returns increased the return on invested assets by approximately 0.4 points to 4.2 percent.\nProperty Casualty Net Premiums Written\nThe following table presents Property Casualty’s net premiums written by major line of business:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(in millions)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nCasualty\n$\n7,649\n$\n8,154\n$\n8,585\n(6)\n%\n(5)\n%\nProperty\n5,136\n4,718\n4,204\nSpecialty\n3,714\n3,737\n3,587\n(1)\nFinancial lines\n4,521\n4,271\n3,972\nTotal Property Casualty net premiums\nwritten\n$\n21,020\n$\n20,880\n$\n20,348\n%\n%\nProperty Casualty NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN by Line of Business\n(in millions)\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nProperty Casualty net premiums written increased in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting increases in new business related to targeted growth products in Property and Financial lines.\nCasualty net premiums written decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the effect on renewals from our strategy to enhance risk selection, particularly in the Americas. Strong growth and new writings in certain lines of business, particularly in EMEA, were more than offset by the declines in the Americas.\nProperty net premiums written increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to new business increases in targeted growth products, and optimization of Property Casualty’s reinsurance structure as part of its decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure.\nWe entered into a catastrophe bond reinsurance transaction, effective as of January 1, 2014, with Tradewynd Re Ltd., which provides Property Casualty and Personal Insurance with up to $400 million of indemnity reinsurance protection against U.S.,\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nGulf of Mexico and Caribbean named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. To fund its potential obligations to us, Tradewynd Re Ltd. issued three tranches of notes. The transaction provides Property Casualty and Personal Insurance with fully collateralized coverage against losses from those events on a per-occurrence basis through December 2016. Catastrophe bond reinsurance transactions reduced net premiums written by $56 million and $140 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSpecialty net premiums written decreased slightly in 2014, compared to 2013 primarily reflecting lower retention and rate decline in the EMEA region. This decline was largely offset by new business increases related to targeted growth products, including growth in small- and medium-sized enterprise markets in the Americas region.\nFinancial lines net premiums written increased in 2014, compared to 2013 reflecting growth in new business related to targeted growth products across all regions, as well as a favorable rate environment in the U.S.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nCasualty net premiums written decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to the execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection, particularly in the Americas and EMEA, as well as to increase specific reinsurance purchases to better manage our exposures. Changes in reinsurance strategy decreased net premiums written by approximately $185 million in 2013, compared to 2012. We implemented rate increases in retained business, especially in the U.S., that partially offset these premium decreases.\nProperty net premiums written increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to growth in new business across all regions, favorable retention in renewal businesses and increases in coverage limits and changes to our per-risk reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks, while continuing to manage aggregate exposure. Catastrophe-exposed businesses in the Americas also benefitted from rate increases.\nThe increase in net premiums written was partially offset by the effect of catastrophe bond transactions which provide coverage for several years with ceded written premium recognized at the inception of the transaction. In 2013, we entered into two multi-year catastrophe bond transactions, which provide $525 million of indemnity protection, in the aggregate, against U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes through the end of 2018. These transactions reduced net premiums written in 2013 by $140 million. There was no similar reduction in 2012 as our previous catastrophe bond issuance occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011.\nSpecialty net premiums written increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to rate increases in environmental business, small-and medium-sized enterprise markets in the Americas region, and new business growth in EMEA. Additionally, the restructuring of our reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, increased net premiums written by $144 million in 2013, compared to 2012.\nFinancial lines net premiums written increased in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting growth in new business related to targeted growth products, particularly in the EMEA region as well as an improved rate environment globally. Global professional indemnity net premiums written increased by $86 million in 2013 compared to 2012, due to improved rates, strong new business growth and the restructuring of our reinsurance program, as part of our decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure.\nSee Part I.

Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased primarily due to increases in targeted growth products, and changes to optimize our reinsurance structure as part of our decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, particularly in Japan.\nEMEA net premiums written increased in 2014 compared to 2013, due to new business growth across all lines of businesses, except for Specialty.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nThe Americas net premiums written increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to rate increases, partially offset by decreases in Casualty business reflecting the execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection and the effect of the timing of the catastrophe reinsurance transactions.\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nAsia Pacific net premiums written increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to organic growth and rate increases in Property, Specialty, and Casualty. In addition, our decision to retain more favorable risks in Property and Financial lines increased net premiums written in 2013 compared to 2012.\nEMEA net premiums written increased in 2013 compared to 2012, due to new business growth, particularly in Property and Financial lines, and a change in reinsurance strategies to retain more favorable risks in those lines.\nProperty Casualty Underwriting Ratios\nThe following tables present the Property Casualty combined ratios based on GAAP data and reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:\nIncrease (Decrease)\nYears Ended December 31,\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nLoss ratio\n71.6\n71.9\n80.5\n(0.3)\n(8.6)\nCatastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums\n(2.9)\n(3.4)\n(10.9)\n0.5\n7.5\nPrior year development net of premium adjustments\n(2.8)\n(1.5)\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\n(0.3)\nNet reserve discount benefit (charge)\n(0.3)\n(1.6)\n0.5\n1.3\n(2.1)\nAccident year loss ratio, as adjusted\n65.6\n65.4\n68.9\n0.2\n(3.5)\nAcquisition ratio\n15.7\n16.1\n16.6\n(0.4)\n(0.5)\nGeneral operating expense ratio\n12.9\n13.6\n13.8\n(0.7)\n(0.2)\nExpense ratio\n28.6\n29.7\n30.4\n(1.1)\n(0.7)\nCombined ratio\n100.2\n101.6\n110.9\n(1.4)\n(9.3)\nCatastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums\n(2.9)\n(3.4)\n(10.9)\n0.5\n7.5\nPrior year development net of premium adjustments\n(2.8)\n(1.5)\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\n(0.3)\nNet reserve discount benefit (charge)\n(0.3)\n(1.6)\n0.5\n1.3\n(2.1)\nAccident year combined ratio, as adjusted\n94.2\n95.1\n99.3\n(0.9)\n(4.2)\nproperty casualty ratios\nSee Insurance Reserves - Non-Life Insurance Companies for further discussion of discounting of reserves and prior year development.\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nThe following tables present Property Casualty’s accident year catastrophe and severe losses by region and number of events:\nCatastrophes(a)\n# of\nAsia\n(in millions)\nEvents\nAmericas\nPacific\nEMEA\nTotal\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nFlooding\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nWindstorms and hailstorms\nTropical cyclone\nEarthquakes\n-\nReinstatement premiums\n-\n-\nTotal catastrophe-related charges\n$\n$\n$\n$\nYear Ended December 31, 2013\nFlooding\n$\n$\n$\n$\nWindstorms and hailstorms\n-\nWildfire\n-\n-\nTropical cyclone\n-\nTotal catastrophe-related charges\n$\n$\n$\n$\nYear Ended December 31, 2012\nFlooding\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nWindstorms and hailstorms\nTropical cyclone(b)\n1,638\n1,760\nDrought\n-\n-\nReinstatement premiums\n-\n-\nTotal catastrophe-related charges\n$\n2,072\n$\n$\n$\n2,270\n(a) Catastrophes are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on Commercial Insurance in excess of $10 million each.\n(b) Includes Storm Sandy flooding and wind damage losses of $1.7 billion.\nSevere Losses*\nYears Ended December 31,\n# of\nAsia\n(in millions)\nEvents\nAmericas\nPacific\nEMEA\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n* Severe losses are defined as non-catastrophe individual first party losses and surety losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance and salvage and subrogation.\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nThe combined ratio decreased by 1.4 points in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting decreases in the expense ratio and the loss ratio.\nThe accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 0.9 points in 2014 compared 2013, primarily due to lower expense ratio which was partially offset by a higher accident year loss ratio, as adjusted.\nThe accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 0.2 points in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to higher frequency of non-severe losses, particularly in Property and Specialty businesses. This was partially offset by an improvement in Financial lines, particularly in the U.S., reflecting enhanced risk selection and pricing discipline. Severe losses represented approximately 2.8 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in both 2014 and 2013.\nThe acquisition ratio decreased by 0.4 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a reduction in expenses of personnel engaged in sales support activities, lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments.\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nThe general operating expense ratio decreased by 0.7 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives, partially offset by higher technology-related expenses and an increase in bad debt expense. In 2013, general operating expenses benefitted from an unusually low bad debt expense.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nThe combined ratio decreased by 9.3 points in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decrease in the loss ratio.\nThe accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, improved by 4.2 points in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a lower accident year loss ratio, as adjusted.\nThe improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, reflects the realization of benefits from the continued execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection, pricing discipline, exposure management and claims processing. Although the execution of these strategies resulted in a reduction of Casualty net premiums written in both the Americas and EMEA regions, it also improved the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. Severe losses represented approximately 2.8 points in 2013 compared to 1.4 points in 2012, and are included in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. In 2013, one single event, totaling $131 million, accounted for approximately 0.6 points of the increase.\nThe acquisition ratio decreased by 0.5 points in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a change in business mix and reinsurance structures.\nThe general operating expense ratio decreased by 0.2 points in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense, which contributed approximately 0.8 points to the decrease, and lower strategic initiatives expenses, which contributed approximately 0.6 points to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in employee incentive plan expense, which represented an approximately 1.0 point increase.\nMortgage Guaranty Results\nThe following table presents Mortgage Guaranty results:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2014 vs. 2013\n2013 vs. 2012\nUnderwriting results:\nNet premiums written\n$\n1,024\n$\n1,048\n$\n(2)\n%\n%\nIncrease in unearned premiums\n(120)\n(239)\n(143)\n(67)\nNet premiums earned\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred\n(57)\n(22)\nAcquisition expenses:\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\nOther acquisition expenses\n(18)\nTotal acquisition expenses\n(11)\nGeneral operating expenses\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n(137)\nNM\nNM\nNet investment income\n(10)\nPre-tax operating income\nNM\nKey metrics:\nPrior year loss reserve development (favorable)/\nunfavorable\n$\n(104)\n$\n$\n(78)\nNM\n%\nNM\n%\nDomestic first-lien:\nNew insurance written\n$\n42,038\n$\n49,356\n$\n37,273\n(15)\nCombined ratio\n52.6\n91.1\n134.4\nRisk in force\n$\n42,106\n$\n36,367\n$\n28,967\n60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans(a)\n4.4\n%\n5.9\n%\n8.8\n%\nDomestic second-lien:\nRisk in force(b)\n$\n$\n1,026\n$\n1,261\n(57)\n(19)\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\n(a) Based on number of policies.\n(b) Represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, which is usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool.

In addition, first-lien pre-tax operating income increased due to a $119 million increase in first-lien net premiums earned in 2014 compared to 2013, largely from growth in the book of business, higher persistency, and, to a lesser extent, the acceleration of premiums earned as the result of the recognition of a shorter expected coverage period on certain single premium business. The decrease in first-lien losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred combined with the increase in earned premiums resulted in an improved combined ratio of 52.6 points in 2014 compared to 91.1 points in 2013.\nAcquisition expenses decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the decrease in new insurance written related to the decline in mortgage originations.\nGeneral operating expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased technology expenses and an impairment charge on certain capitalized technology costs.\nOther Business Results\nOther business results include second-lien insurance, student loan insurance and non-domestic mortgage insurance operations.\nThe Other business’ pre-tax operating income for 2014 was $82 million compared to $27 million in 2013. The increase in pre-tax operating income is due to a decline in losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred of $62 million and a $17 million reduction in underwriting expenses, partially offset by a decline in net premiums earned of $22 million and a decline in net investment income of $2 million.\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nand 2012 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to an increase in net premiums earned and a decline in incurred losses from lower delinquency rates and higher cure rates.\nFirst Lien Results\nFirst-lien pre-tax operating income increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to improved underwriting income as a result of a $157 million decrease in first-lien losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred reflecting lower newly reported delinquencies and higher cure rates and a $127 million increase in first-lien net premiums earned largely from growth in the book of business in 2013. This increase was partially offset by $46 million of unfavorable prior year development in 2013 compared to unfavorable prior year development of $17 million in 2012. The decline in first-lien losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred combined with the increase in earned premiums resulted in an improved combined ratio of 91.1 points in 2013 compared to 134.4 points in 2012.\nAcquisition expenses increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of the increase in new insurance written related to the increase in mortgage originations resulting from the addition and expansion in distribution channels.\nGeneral operating expenses increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to increased servicing costs related to the growth in the in-force business.\nOther Business Results\nOther business results include second-lien insurance, student loan insurance and non-domestic mortgage insurance operations.\nThe Other business’ pre-tax operating income for 2013 was $27 million, $56 million lower than 2012. The decline in pre-tax operating income was primarily due to a decline in net premiums earned of $32 million and an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred of $12 million, and a $2 million increase in underwriting expenses.\nNew Insurance Written\nThe decline in domestic first-lien new insurance written to $42.0 billion in 2014 from $49.4 billion in 2013 was primarily due to the contraction in the mortgage originations market and an increase in competition.\nNew insurance written increased to $49.4 billion in 2013 from $37.3 billion in 2012 due to the increase in mortgage originations.\nDelinquency Inventory\nThe delinquency inventory for domestic first lien business declined during 2014 as a result of cures and paid claims exceeding the number of newly reported delinquencies. Mortgage Guaranty’s first lien primary delinquency ratio at December 31, 2014 was 4.4 percent compared to 5.9 percent at December 31, 2013. Over the last several quarters, Mortgage Guaranty has experienced a decline in newly reported defaults and an increase in cure rates.\nThe delinquency inventory for domestic first lien business declined during 2013 as a result of higher cure rates and fewer newly reported delinquencies. Mortgage Guaranty’s first lien primary delinquency ratio at December 31, 2013 was 5.9 percent compared to 8.8 percent at December 31, 2012.\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nThe following table provides a summary of activity in Mortgage Guaranty’s domestic first lien delinquency inventory:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(number of policies)\nNumber of delinquencies at the beginning of the year\n47,518\n62,832\n94,034\nNewly reported\n47,239\n56,194\n70,552\nCures\n(42,680)\n(51,283)\n(58,993)\nClaims paid\n(11,601)\n(19,862)\n(30,712)\nOther\n(2,119)\n(363)\n(12,049)\nNumber of delinquencies at the end of the year\n38,357\n47,518\n62,832\nMortgage Guaranty Underwriting Ratios\nThe following tables present the Mortgage Guaranty combined ratios based on GAAP data:\nYears Ended December 31,\nIncrease (Decrease)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nLoss ratio\n24.7\n63.5\n92.2\n(38.8)\n(28.7)\nAcquisition ratio\n7.8\n9.9\n9.5\n(2.1)\n0.4\nGeneral operating expense ratio\n17.3\n17.5\n17.5\n(0.2)\n-\nExpense ratio\n25.1\n27.4\n27.0\n(2.3)\n0.4\nCombined ratio\n49.8\n90.9\n119.2\n(41.1)\n(28.3)\nand 2013 Comparison\nThe combined ratio decreased by 41.1 points in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in the loss ratio due to lower losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred from fewer new delinquencies, favorable prior year loss reserve development, and higher cure rates.\nThe acquisition ratio decreased by 2.1 points in 2014 compared to 2013. Acquisition expenses decreased compared to an increase in net premiums earned, driven by the decreases in new insurance written in 2014 due to lower mortgage originations.\nThe general operating expense ratio decreased by 0.2 points in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was driven primarily by growth in earned premiums.\nand 2012 Comparison\nThe combined ratio decreased by 28.3 points in 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in the loss ratio by 28.7 points in 2013 due to lower losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred.\nThe acquisition ratio increased by 0.4 points in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase in acquisition expense was driven by the increase in mortgage originations.\nThe general operating expense ratio remained relatively unchanged in 2013 compared to 2012.\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nInstitutional Markets Results\nThe following table presents Institutional Markets results:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(in millions)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nRevenues:\nPremiums\n$\n$\n$\n(29)\n%\n%\nPolicy fees\nNet investment income\n1,957\n2,090\n2,066\n(6)\nBenefits and expenses:\nPolicyholder benefits and losses incurred\n1,396\n1,616\n1,432\n(14)\nInterest credited to policyholder account balances\n(1)\n(28)\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n-\nOther acquisition expenses\n(17)\n(8)\nGeneral operating expenses\nPre-tax operating income\n$\n$\n$\n(1)\nINSTITUTIONAL MARKETS pre-tax OPERATING INCOME (in millions)\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income for 2014 decreased slightly compared to 2013, as a decrease in net investment income was only partially offset by an increase in fee income. The increase in fee income was driven by growth in reserves and assets under management, primarily from strong development of the stable value wrap business. The notional amount of stable value wrap assets under management at December 31, 2014 grew by $7.8 billion or 32 percent from December 31, 2013, which excluded a $2.5 billion deposit to the separate accounts for a stable value funding agreement. Growth in reserves also reflected a GIC deposit of $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 under a funding agreement-backed notes issuance program, in which an unaffiliated, non-consolidated statutory trust issues to investors medium-term notes, which are secured by GICs issued by one of the Life Insurance Companies. Under the funding agreement-backed notes program, issuances will be made opportunistically based upon pricing and demand available in the marketplace.\nNet investment income for 2014 decreased compared to 2013, primarily due to lower net investment income from alternative investments and from the base portfolio. The 2014 decrease in alternative investment income of $41 million compared to 2013 primarily reflected high hedge fund income in 2013 due to favorable equity market conditions. The decrease in base net investment income in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflected lower base portfolio yield as a result of reinvestment in the\nItem 7 / results of operations / commercial insurance\nlow interest rate environment, partially offset by growth in average assets. See MD&A - Investments - Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Institutional Markets business.\nGeneral operating expenses in 2014 increased slightly compared to 2013, primarily due to investments in technology.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income for 2013 increased compared to 2012, due in part to higher net investment income from alternative investments, partially offset by lower base net investment income. Interest credited to policyholder account balances in 2012 included $110 million of expense resulting from a comprehensive review of reserves for the GIC portfolio. Results for 2013 included a full year of the growing stable value wrap business, which contributed $31 million to the increase in pre-tax operating income compared to 2012. Stable value wrap notional assets under management grew to $24.6 billion at December 31, 2013 from $10.4 billion at December 31, 2012, including the notional amount of contracts transferred from an AIG affiliate.\nNet investment income for 2013 increased slightly compared to 2012, primarily due to higher net investment income from alternative investments, largely offset by lower income from the base portfolio. The increase in alternative investment income in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected higher hedge fund income due to favorable equity market conditions. The decrease in base net income was primarily due to investment of available cash, including proceeds from sales of securities made during 2013 to utilize capital loss carryforwards, at rates below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio.\nGeneral operating expenses in 2013 increased compared to 2012, primarily to support increased volume in the stable value wrap business.\nInstitutional Markets Premiums, Deposits and Net Flows\nFor Institutional Markets, premiums represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent payout annuities or structured settlements. Premiums and deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed premiums as well as deposits received on universal life insurance and investment-type annuity contracts, including GICs and stable value wrap funding agreements.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Institutional Markets premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nPremiums and deposits\n$\n3,797\n$\n$\nDeposits\n(3,344)\n(354)\n(289)\nOther\n(21)\n(27)\n(27)\nPremiums\n$\n$\n$\nThe decrease in premiums in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a high volume of single-premium products sold in 2013, including life-contingent payout annuities. Sales of these products decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a more competitive environment as well as continued low interest rates. The increase in deposits in 2014 compared to 2013 included a $2.5 billion deposit to the separate accounts of one of the Life Insurance Companies for a stable value wrap funding agreement. The majority of stable value wrap sales are measured based on the notional amount included in assets under management, but do not include the receipt of funds that would be included in premiums and deposits. The increase in deposits in 2014 compared to 2013 also reflected a $450 million GIC issued in 2014.\nThe increase in premiums in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected a high volume of single-premium product sales in 2013, including structured settlements with life contingencies and terminal funding annuities. The increase in deposits in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected strong sales of high net worth products, primarily private placement variable annuities.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nConsumer insurance\nConsumer Insurance Results\nThe following table presents Consumer Insurance results:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(in millions)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nRevenues:\nPremiums\n$\n14,936\n$\n15,302\n$\n16,027\n(2)\n%\n(5)\n%\nPolicy fees\n2,453\n2,252\n2,113\nNet investment income\n9,082\n9,352\n9,262\n(3)\nOther income\n1,998\n1,754\n1,344\nBenefits and expenses:\nPolicyholder benefits and losses incurred\n10,796\n10,957\n11,696\n(1)\n(6)\nInterest credited to policyholder account balances\n3,353\n3,477\n3,769\n(4)\n(8)\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n2,759\n2,836\n2,850\n(3)\n-\nGeneral operating and other expenses*\n7,087\n6,826\n6,695\nPre-tax operating income\n$\n4,474\n$\n4,564\n$\n3,736\n(2)\n%\n%\n* Includes general operating expenses, non deferrable commissions, other acquisition expenses, advisory fee expenses and other expenses.\nConsumer Insurance Results by Operating Segment\nConsumer Insurance presents its operating results in three operating segments - Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance.

The increase in policy fees was driven by growth in variable annuity separate account assets from positive net flows and favorable equity markets. A higher volume of commissions and advisory fees included in Other income, net of related expenses, was driven by increased assets under management.\nPre-tax operating income in both years included a net positive impact from the update of certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in the investment-oriented product lines, which resulted in a $246 million net increase in pre-tax operating income in 2014, compared to a $233 million net increase in pre-tax operating income in 2013. See Insurance Reserves - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Update of Actuarial Assumptions for amounts by product line and financial statement line item and additional discussion.\nNet investment income for 2014 decreased compared to 2013, primarily due to a $158 million decrease in income from alternative investments, including higher hedge fund income in 2013, which benefited from favorable equity market conditions and several large hedge fund redemptions. The decrease in hedge fund income in 2014 compared to 2013 was partially offset by an increase in private equity fund income.\nBase net investment income for 2014 increased slightly compared to 2013, as participation income on a commercial mortgage loan and income from the redemption of an invested asset in 2014 more than offset the effect of lower base yields from reinvestment at rates below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio. See Investments - Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Retirement business.\nOverall, Retirement fixed maturity portfolio yields in 2014 declined compared to 2013, primarily as a result of investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the historically low interest rate environment. The Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement product lines were able to maintain base spreads in 2014 at a level comparable to 2013, and Retirement Income Solutions base spread increased, as a result of active crediting rate management. See Spread Management below for additional discussion.\nGeneral operating expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013, due in part to technology investments and the volume of continued sales growth of annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions and Fixed Annuities product lines.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income for Retirement in 2013 increased significantly compared to 2012, reflecting higher fee income from variable annuities driven by growth in assets under management, active spread management in interest rate sensitive product lines, higher alternative investment income, and higher positive impact of actuarial assumption updates. Commissions and advisory fees reflected in Advisory fee and other income, and related Advisory fee expenses, were both higher in 2013 compared to 2012 principally due to the acquisition of Woodbury Financial Services Inc. (Woodbury Financial) in November 2012.\nPre-tax operating income in 2013 included a net increase of $233 million from adjustments to update certain gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in investment-oriented product lines, compared to a net increase of $84 million in 2012. See Insurance Reserves - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Update of Actuarial Assumptions for additional information on assumption updates.\nNet investment income for 2013 increased compared to 2012, primarily due to higher income from alternative investments, partially offset by ML II fair value gains recognized in 2012 and lower base income due to reinvestment of investment proceeds at lower rates. The $340 million increase in alternative investment income in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected higher hedge fund income in 2013 due to favorable equity market conditions and several large redemptions from hedge funds.\nGeneral operating expenses increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily to support stronger sales of annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions and Fixed Annuities product lines and increased Retail Mutual Fund sales. Higher operating expenses in 2013 also reflected the acquisition of Woodbury Financial in November 2012, and the absence of guaranty fund assessment credits received in 2012.\nSpread Management\nThe contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may have the effect, in a sustained low interest rate environment, of reducing spreads and thus reducing future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the Life Insurance Companies’ asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.\nDisciplined pricing on new business and active crediting rate management have allowed the Retirement operating segment to maintain base investment spread rates in the Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement product lines for 2014 at a level comparable to 2013, during a period in which base yields continued to decline due to investment of available cash flows in the low interest rate environment, including the full year impact from reinvestment of proceeds from sales made during 2013 to utilize capital loss carryforwards. The base investment spread rates for the Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement product line improved in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of our disciplined pricing and management of renewal crediting rates.\nDisciplined pricing on new business is used to pursue new sales of annuity products at targeted net investment spreads in the current rate environment. Retirement has an active product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Retirement cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products that had higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales. As a result, new sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of one percent.\nRenewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions in annuity products that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Retirement has adjusted, and will continue to adjust, crediting rates to maintain targeted net investment spreads on in-force business. In addition to deferred annuity products, certain traditional long-duration products for which Retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment. See Insurance Reserves - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Loss Recognition for additional discussion.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nAs of December 31, 2014, Retirement’s fixed annuity reserves, which include fixed options offered within variable annuities sold in the Group Retirement and Retirement Income Solutions product lines as well as reserves of the Fixed Annuities product line, had minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older in-force products. As indicated in the table below, approximately 71 percent of annuity account values were at their minimum crediting rates as of December 31, 2014, compared to 74 percent at December 31, 2013. The decrease during 2014 in the percentage of annuity account values at the minimum crediting rate was primarily due to new deposits that were crediting at rates above the contractual minimum, and may include sales inducements, as well as the run-off of older business that was at minimum crediting rates. As a result of disciplined pricing on new business and the run-off of older business with higher minimum interest crediting rates, fixed annuity account values having contractual minimum guaranteed rates above 1 percent decreased from 84 percent at December 31, 2013 to 79 percent at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table presents fixed annuity account values by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates:\nCurrent Crediting Rates\nDecember 31, 2014\n1-50 Basis\nMore than 50\nContractual Minimum Guaranteed\nAt Contractual\nPoints Above\nBasis Points\nInterest Rate\nMinimum\nMinimum\nAbove Minimum\n(in millions)\nGuarantee\nGuarantee\nGuarantee\nTotal\nFixed annuities *\n1%\n$\n2,277\n$\n7,732\n$\n10,271\n$\n20,280\n> 1% - 2%\n12,450\n3,502\n4,453\n20,405\n> 2% - 3%\n31,674\n1,818\n33,628\n> 3% - 4%\n12,922\n12,987\n> 4% - 5%\n7,966\n-\n7,970\n> 5% - 5.5%\n-\nTotal\n$\n67,513\n$\n11,421\n$\n16,565\n$\n95,499\nPercentage of total\n%\n%\n%\n%\n* Fixed annuities shown include fixed options within variable annuities sold in Group Retirement and Retirement Income Solutions product lines.\nRetirement Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows\nPremiums\nFor Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums and deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Retirement premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nPremiums and deposits\n$\n24,023\n$\n23,729\n$\n16,048\nDeposits\n(23,903)\n(23,690)\n(16,203)\nOther\nPremiums\n$\n$\n$\nPremiums increased in 2014 compared to 2013, and in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to higher immediate annuity premiums in the Fixed Annuities product line.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nPremiums and Deposits and Net Flows\nThe following table presents Retirement premiums and deposits and net flows by product line:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(in millions)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nFixed Annuities\n$\n3,578\n$\n2,914\n$\n1,469\n%\n%\nRetirement Income Solutions\n10,325\n8,608\n4,828\nRetail Mutual Funds\n3,377\n4,956\n2,723\n(32)\nGroup Retirement\n6,743\n7,251\n7,028\n(7)\nTotal Retirement premiums and deposits*\n$\n24,023\n$\n23,729\n$\n16,048\n%\n%\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nNet flows\nFixed Annuities\n$\n(2,313)\n$\n(2,820)\n$\n(4,252)\nRetirement Income Solutions\n6,566\n5,092\n1,598\nRetail Mutual Funds\n(1)\n2,780\n1,018\nGroup Retirement\n(3,797)\n(492)\nTotal Retirement net flows*\n$\n$\n4,560\n$\n(1,334)\n* Excludes activity related to closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities, which had reserves of approximately $5.4 billion and $6.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nRETIREMENT PREMIUMS AND DEPOSITS by Product Line (in millions)\nPremiums and deposits for Retirement increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to continued strong demand for variable and fixed index annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions product lines and improved sales in Fixed Annuities, partially offset by lower deposits in Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement. Premiums and deposits improved significantly in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to strong sales across all product lines. See below for additional discussion of each product line.\nNet flows for annuity products included in the Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows from mutual funds, which are included in both the Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement product lines, represent deposits less withdrawals.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nTotal net flows for Retirement decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, as higher surrenders and withdrawals in 2014, primarily in the Group Retirement and Retail Mutual Fund product lines, resulted in a significant decrease in net flows compared to 2013. Net flows for Retirement increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the increase in premiums and deposits, partially offset by higher surrenders in Group Retirement and Retail Mutual Funds. See below for additional discussion of each product line.\nPremiums and Deposits and Net Flows by Product Line\nA discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows:\nFixed Annuities deposits increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to modest increases in interest rates and steepening of the yield curve in the first half of 2014, compared to lower rates in the prior year, particularly in the first half of 2013. The increase in Fixed Annuities deposits in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to the increase in market interest rates in the second half of 2013. Fixed Annuities net flows continued to be negative, but improved slightly in 2014 compared to 2013, and improved significantly in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the increased deposits.\nRetirement Income Solutions premiums and deposits and net flows increased significantly in 2014 compared to 2013, and in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting a continued high volume of variable and index annuity sales, which have benefitted from consumer demand for retirement products with guaranteed benefit features, product enhancements, expanded distribution and a more favorable competitive environment. The improvement in the surrender rate (see Surrender Rates below) was primarily due to the significant growth in account value driven by the high volume of sales, which has increased the proportion of business that is within the surrender charge period.\nRetail Mutual Fund deposits and net flows decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased in 2013 compared to 2012. These variances were primarily driven by activity in the Focused Dividend Strategy Fund, which had record sales in 2013. In 2014, the relative performance of the fund declined, putting pressure on sales and withdrawal activity.\nGroup Retirement net flows decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher group surrender activity, as well as lower premiums and deposits. The increase in surrenders and surrender rate for 2014 compared to 2013 included large group surrenders of approximately $2.7 billion, but reserves of this product line grew in 2014 compared to 2013, and the 2014 surrender activity is not expected to have a significant impact on pre-tax operating income in 2015. The large group market has become increasingly competitive and has been impacted by the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in our target markets. This trend of heightened competition is expected to continue in 2015 as plan sponsors perform reviews of existing retirement plan relationships. The decrease in Group Retirement net flows in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily a result of higher surrenders of individual participants as well as large group surrenders.\nSurrender Rates\nThe following table presents reserves for annuity product lines by surrender charge category:\nAt December 31,\nGroup\nRetirement\nGroup\nRetirement\nRetirement\nFixed\nIncome\nRetirement\nFixed\nIncome\n(in millions)\nProducts(a)\nAnnuities\nSolutions\nProducts(a)\nAnnuities\nSolutions\nNo surrender charge(b)\n$\n61,751\n$\n34,396\n$\n1,871\n$\n60,962\n$\n30,906\n$\n2,065\n0% - 2%\n1,648\n2,736\n17,070\n1,508\n2,261\n16,839\nGreater than 2% - 4%\n1,657\n2,842\n4,254\n1,967\n4,349\n2,734\nGreater than 4%\n5,793\n12,754\n26,165\n5,719\n16,895\n19,039\nNon-surrenderable\n3,464\n2,758\nTotal reserves\n$\n71,619\n$\n56,192\n$\n49,511\n$\n70,471\n$\n57,169\n$\n40,744\n(a) Excludes mutual fund assets under management of $14.6 billion and $15.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n(b) Group Retirement Products in this category include reserves of approximately $6.2 billion at both December 31, 2014 and 2013 that are subject to 20 percent annual withdrawal limitations.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nThe following table presents surrender rates for deferred annuities by product line:\nYears Ended December 31,\nSurrenders as a percentage of average account value\nFixed Annuities\n7.0\n%\n6.6\n%\n6.3\n%\nRetirement Income Solutions\n7.1\n8.7\n10.3\nGroup Retirement\n11.6\n9.0\n8.7\nLife Results\nThe following table presents Life results:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(in millions)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nRevenues:\nPremiums\n$\n2,679\n$\n2,737\n$\n2,804\n(2)\n%\n(2)\n%\nPolicy fees\n1,443\n1,391\n1,370\nNet investment income\n2,199\n2,269\n2,283\n(3)\n(1)\nBenefits and expenses:\nPolicyholder benefits and losses incurred\n3,771\n3,568\n3,601\n(1)\nInterest credited to policyholder account balances\n(6)\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n(11)\n(10)\nNon deferrable insurance commissions\n(6)\n(13)\nGeneral operating expenses\n(5)\nPre-tax operating income\n$\n$\n$\n(28)\nLife pre-tax OPERATING INCOME (in millions)\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to increases in policyholder benefit reserves, lower net investment income and higher general operating expenses. Updates of actuarial assumptions also decreased pre-tax operating income by $119 million in 2014 compared to $80 million in 2013. The assumption updates in 2014 included $87 million of loss recognition expense to increase reserves for certain long-term care business. These decreases were partially offset by a $28 million increase in pre-tax operating income in 2014 compared to 2013, due to a 2013 increase in equity-indexed universal life reserves, which was reflected in Interest credited to policyholder account balances.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nOverall, mortality experience for 2014 was similar to 2013 and within pricing assumptions. Policyholder benefit expense in 2014 included an increase of approximately $104 million to the estimated reserves for IBNR death claims, which reflected continuing efforts to identify deceased insureds and their beneficiaries who have not presented a valid claim, pursuant to the 2012 resolution of a multi-state audit and market conduct examination. The 2014 increase in the IBNR reserve was related primarily to a legacy block of in-force and lapsed small face amount policies, for which the personal data elements to effect a match against the Social Security Death Master File are unavailable or incomplete, such as full legal name, date of birth or Social Security number. In 2014, in the process of reviewing these policies as required under the terms of the regulatory agreement, we have refined our estimate of the ultimate cost of these claims. The $104 million reserve increase in 2014 was in addition to amounts previously provided for IBNR claims in 2011 and 2012, which totaled $259 million. While we believe that we are adequately reserved for such claims, there can be no assurance that the ultimate cost will not vary from the current estimate.\nNet investment income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower income from alternative investments and lower yields on the base portfolio due to investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio. See Investments - Life Insurance Companies for additional discussion of the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Life business.\nGeneral operating expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to strategic investments in technology and service platforms in the U.S. and Japan.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to additional expenses recorded in 2012, which included $67 million of loss recognition reserves for long-term care products, $57 million of additional IBNR claim reserves and an $11 million regulatory assessment related to the resolution of multi-state regulatory examinations of death claims practices, and an accrual of $20 million from consolidation of certain life operations and administrative systems. The increase in pre-tax operating income in 2013 due to the absence of these prior year expenses was partially offset by a $28 million increase in equity indexed universal life reserves in 2013, as well as a higher net negative adjustment of $80 million in 2013, compared to $43 million in 2012, to update certain gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for universal life products.\nNet investment income in 2013 decreased slightly compared to 2012, due to the absence of ML II fair value gains recognized in 2012 and reinvestment of investment proceeds at lower rates, partially offset by higher income from alternative investments.\nGeneral operating expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to operational efficiencies driven by technology improvements and process consolidation efforts.\nSpread Management\nDisciplined pricing on new business is used to continue to pursue new sales of life products at targeted net investment spreads in a low interest rate environment. Life has a dynamic product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Life cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and zero to 2 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to be sufficiently low to meet targeted net investment spreads.\nIn-force Management. Crediting rates for in-force policies are adjusted in accordance with contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nThe following table presents universal life account values by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates:\nCurrent Crediting Rates\nDecember 31, 2014\n1-50 Basis\nMore than 50\nContractual Minimum Guaranteed\nAt Contractual\nPoints Above\nBasis Points\nInterest Rate\nMinimum\nMinimum\nAbove Minimum\n(in millions)\nGuarantee\nGuarantee\nGuarantee\nTotal\nUniversal life insurance\n1%\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n> 1% - 2%\n> 2% - 3%\n1,372\n2,304\n> 3% - 4%\n2,119\n1,157\n3,792\n> 4% - 5%\n4,039\n-\n4,228\n> 5% - 5.5%\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n7,122\n$\n1,233\n$\n2,746\n$\n11,101\nPercentage of total\n%\n%\n%\n%\nLife Premiums and Deposits\nPremiums for Life represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and group benefit policies.

The decrease in premiums for 2013 compared to 2012 was the result of the run-off of an older block of traditional life in the U.S. and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, which exceeded the increase from new sales of traditional products.\nPremiums and deposits decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, due to the decrease in premiums, and were consistent in 2013 with 2012.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nPersonal Insurance Results\nThe following table presents Personal Insurance results:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(in millions)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nUnderwriting results:\nNet premiums written\n$\n12,412\n$\n12,700\n$\n13,302\n(2)\n%\n(5)\n%\nIncrease in unearned premiums\n(442)\n(323)\n(199)\n(37)\n(62)\nNet premiums earned\n11,970\n12,377\n13,103\n(3)\n(6)\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred\n6,488\n7,025\n7,764\n(8)\n(10)\nAcquisition expenses:\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n2,092\n2,203\n2,047\n(5)\nOther acquisition expenses\n1,165\n1,044\n1,273\n(18)\nTotal acquisition expenses\n3,257\n3,247\n3,320\n-\n(2)\nGeneral operating expenses\n2,220\n2,292\n2,297\n(3)\n-\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n(187)\n(278)\nNM\nNet investment income\n(13)\n(5)\nPre-tax operating income\n$\n$\n$\n%\n%\nNET PREMIUMS WRITTEN\n(in millions)\nPre-Tax oPERATING INCOME\n(in millions)\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in current accident year losses and lower general operating expenses, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior year loss reserve development, higher acquisition expenses and a decrease in net investment income. Catastrophe losses were $126 million in 2014, compared to $77 million in 2013. The accident year losses include severe losses of approximately $54 million in 2014 compared to $17 million in 2013. Net favorable loss reserve development was $77 million in 2014 compared to $155 million in 2013, and included approximately $7 million of favorable loss reserve development from Storm Sandy compared to $41 million in 2013. Foreign exchange did not have a significant impact on the pre-tax operating income compared to 2013.\nAcquisition expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the change in business mix and higher costs in growth-targeted lines of business, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, for 2014 were $392 million, compared to\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\n$440 million in 2013. These expenses, while not deferrable, are expected to generate business that has an average expected overall persistency of approximately five years and, in Japan, where the majority of the expenses are incurred, approximately nine years. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, direct marketing expenses decreased by approximately $24 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Direct marketing accounted for approximately 17 percent of net premiums written in both 2014 and 2013.\nGeneral operating expenses decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, general operating expenses remained flat, as efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives were offset by increased technology-related expenses.\nNet investment income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates during 2014, as yields on new purchases were lower than the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio, lower income on alternative investments, and lower income associated with investments accounted for under the fair value option method as an increase related to the PICC P&C rights offerings was more than offset by a decrease from fixed maturity investments accounted for under the fair value option. These were partially offset by the effect of continued portfolio diversification. Additionally, the decrease in allocated net investment income was also due to a reduction in net loss reserves.\nSee MD&A - Investments for additional information on the Non-Life Insurance Companies invested assets, investment strategy, and asset-liability management process.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nPre-tax operating income increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a lower underwriting loss, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income. Underwriting results improved primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net favorable loss reserve development, coupled with lower acquisition expenses. Catastrophe losses in 2013 were $77 million, compared to $382 million in 2012. Net favorable loss reserve development was $155 million in 2013, compared to $20 million in 2012. Additionally, 2013 included approximately $41 million of favorable loss reserve development from Storm Sandy. Foreign exchange did not have a significant impact on pre-tax operating income compared to 2012.\nAcquisition expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the change in business mix, partially offset by increased costs in growth-targeted lines of business. Direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, for 2013 were $440 million, compared to $452 million in 2012. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, direct marketing expenses increased by approximately $46 million in 2013 compared to 2012.\nGeneral operating expenses decreased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to reduced costs of strategic initiatives, technology-related and infrastructure expenses. These were largely offset by the increase in employee incentive plan expenses, which reflected the alignment of employee performance with the overall performance of the organization, including our stock performance, and accelerated vesting provisions for retirement-eligible individuals in the 2013 share-based plan, as well as the strategic expansion into growth economy nations.\nNet investment income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a change in allocated investment income as a result of lower net loss reserves from a change in the business mix.\nPersonal Insurance Net Premiums Written\nThe following table presents Personal Insurance net premiums written by major line of business:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(in millions)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nAccident & Health\n$\n5,441\n$\n5,714\n$\n6,089\n(5)\n%\n(6)\n%\nPersonal Lines\n6,971\n6,986\n7,213\n-\n(3)\nTotal Personal Insurance net premiums written\n$\n12,412\n$\n12,700\n$\n13,302\n(2)\n%\n(5)\n%\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nPersonal Insurance\n(in millions)\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nPersonal Insurance net premiums written decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in 2014 compared to 2013 as the business continued to grow through multiple product and distribution channels, including direct marketing.\nA&H net premiums written decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to our focus on maintaining underwriting discipline in certain classes of business in the U.S., partially offset by growth in Japan and Latin America.\nPersonal Lines net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased rates and improved retention in AIG Private Client Group and continued growth of automobile business outside of Japan, partially offset by declines in the U.S. warranty service programs.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nPersonal Insurance net premiums written decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in 2013 compared to 2012 as the business continued to build momentum through multiple distribution channels.\nA&H net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to our focused strategy to grow sales through the direct marketing distribution channel, individual A&H in Asia Pacific, and the travel business which continued to increase in most geographies across the globe.\nPersonal Lines net premiums written, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, increased in 2013 compared to 2012. The increases were driven by growth in AIG Private Client Group and the warranty service programs, automobile products and the continued execution of our strategic initiative to grow higher value lines of business. In addition, the impact of excess of loss ceded premiums and of the catastrophe bond issuances reduced net premiums written by $58 million compared to 2012.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nPersonal Insurance Net Premiums Written by Region\nThe following table presents Personal Insurance net premiums written by region:\nPercentage Change in\nPercentage Change in\nYears Ended December 31,\nU.S. dollars\nOriginal Currency\n(in millions)\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nAmericas\n$\n3,824\n$\n3,794\n$\n3,779\n%\n-\n%\n%\n%\nAsia Pacific\n6,516\n6,893\n7,714\n(5)\n(11)\nEMEA\n2,072\n2,013\n1,809\nTotal net premiums written\n$\n12,412\n$\n12,700\n$\n13,302\n(2)\n%\n(5)\n%\n%\n%\nPersonal insurance NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN by Region\n(in millions)\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nAmericas net premiums written increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in all product lines in our Latin America operations and growth in U.S. personal property and automobile businesses. These were partially offset by a decrease in U.S. A&H due to our continued focus on maintaining underwriting discipline.\nAsia Pacific net premiums written decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased, primarily due to production increases in Japan A&H and in property and automobile business outside of Japan.\nEMEA net premiums written increased in 2014 compared to 2013, due to growth in the automobile business and warranty service programs, partially offset by a decrease in the A&H business.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nAmericas net premiums written increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to continued growth in property, the AIG Private Client Group and rate actions related to the warranty retail program. This was partially offset by the effect of the timing of catastrophe bond reinsurance transactions.\nAsia Pacific net premiums written decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased primarily due to our focused strategy to grow sales through the direct marketing distribution channel. The expansion of business in Asia Pacific countries outside of Japan was driven by an increase in individual personal accident insurance and personal lines products.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nEMEA net premiums written increased in 2013 compared to 2012, due to growth in all lines of Personal Insurance.\nPersonal Insurance Underwriting Ratios\nThe following tables present the Personal Insurance combined ratios based on GAAP data and reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:\nIncrease (Decrease)\nYears Ended December 31,\nvs. 2013\nvs. 2012\nLoss ratio\n54.2\n56.8\n59.3\n(2.6)\n(2.5)\nCatastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums\n(1.1)\n(0.7)\n(3.0)\n(0.4)\n2.3\nPrior year development net of premium adjustments\n0.7\n1.3\n0.2\n(0.6)\n1.1\nNet reserve discount benefit\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAccident year loss ratio, as adjusted\n53.8\n57.4\n56.5\n(3.6)\n0.9\nAcquisition ratio\n27.2\n26.2\n25.3\n1.0\n0.9\nGeneral operating expense ratio\n18.5\n18.5\n17.5\n-\n1.0\nExpense ratio\n45.7\n44.7\n42.8\n1.0\n1.9\nCombined ratio\n99.9\n101.5\n102.1\n(1.6)\n(0.6)\nCatastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums\n(1.1)\n(0.7)\n(3.0)\n(0.4)\n2.3\nPrior year development net of premium adjustments\n0.7\n1.3\n0.2\n(0.6)\n1.1\nNet reserve discount benefit\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAccident year combined ratio, as adjusted\n99.5\n102.1\n99.3\n(2.6)\n2.8\nPersonal Insurance ratios\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\nThe following tables present Personal Insurance accident year catastrophe and severe losses by region and the number of events:\nCatastrophes*\n# of\nAsia\n(in millions)\nEvents\nAmericas\nPacific\nEMEA\nTotal\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nFlooding\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nWindstorms and hailstorms\n-\nTropical cyclone\n-\nEarthquakes\n-\n-\nReinstatement premiums\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal catastrophe-related charges\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\nYear Ended December 31, 2013\nFlooding\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\nWindstorms and hailstorms\n-\nTropical cyclone\n-\n-\n-\nTotal catastrophe-related charges\n$\n$\n$\n$\nYear Ended December 31, 2012\nFlooding\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nWindstorms and hailstorms\n-\nTropical cyclone\n-\nDrought\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nReinstatement premiums\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal catastrophe-related charges\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n* Catastrophes are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on Personal Insurance in excess of $10 million each.\nSevere Losses*\nYears Ended December 31,\n# of\nAsia\n(in millions)\nEvents\nAmericas\nPacific\nEMEA\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n* Severe losses are defined as non-catastrophe individual first party losses and surety losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance and salvage and subrogation.\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nThe combined ratio decreased by 1.6 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a lower loss ratio, partially offset by a higher acquisition ratio as discussed below.\nThe accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 2.6 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to an improved accident year loss ratio, as adjusted.\nThe accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 3.6 points in 2014 compared to 2013, as a result of improvements across all lines of business. The lower losses associated with a warranty retail program were largely offset by an increase in the related profit sharing arrangement, which increased the acquisition ratio in 2014 compared to 2013. The severe losses of $54 million, resulting largely from four fire claims, accounted for 0.5 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in 2014.\nThe general operating expense ratio remained unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting the impact of efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives, offset by increased technology-related expenses.\nItem 7 / results of operations / consumer insurance\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nThe combined ratio decreased by 0.6 points in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a lower loss ratio, partially offset by higher acquisition and expense ratios as discussed below.\nThe accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, increased by 2.8 points in 2013 compared to 2012.\nThe accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 0.9 points in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the effect of higher losses associated with a warranty retail program, group accident, and travel business in the U.S. and Canada, which in the aggregate increased the loss ratio by 1.7 points. This was partially offset by improvements in automobile and personal property, as a result of rate and underwriting actions taken in 2013 and prior years. The higher losses associated with the warranty retail program were largely offset by a decrease in the related profit sharing arrangement reflected in acquisition costs.\nThe acquisition ratio increased by 0.9 points in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the combined effect of lower net premiums earned base, change in business mix and higher costs in growth-targeted lines of business. This was partially offset by a decrease in a profit sharing arrangement associated with the warranty retail program noted above.\nThe general operating expense ratio increased by 1.0 point in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the increase in employee incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower infrastructure project costs.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other Results\nThe following table presents AIG’s Corporate and Other results:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n(in millions)\n2014 vs. 2013\n2013 vs. 2012\nCorporate and Other pre-tax operating loss:\nDirect Investment book\n$\n1,241\n$\n1,448\n$\n1,215\n(14)\n%\n%\nGlobal Capital Markets\n(43)\nRun-off insurance Lines\n(445)\n(135)\nNM\nNM\nOther businesses\n(97)\n(87)\nNM\n(11)\nAIG Parent and Other:\nEquity in pre-tax operating earnings of AerCap(b)\n-\n-\nNM\nNM\nFair value earnings on PICC Group shares(c)\n-\n-\nNM\nNM\nCorporate expenses, net:\nOther income (expense), net\n(40)\nGeneral operating expenses\n(1,146)\n(1,115)\n(1,054)\n(3)\n(6)\nTotal Corporate expenses, net\n(1,018)\n(1,025)\n(905)\n(13)\nSeverance expense(a)\n-\n(265)\n-\nNM\nNM\nInterest expense\n(1,233)\n(1,412)\n(1,597)\nTotal AIG Parent and Other operating loss\n(1,780)\n(2,702)\n(2,502)\n(8)\nRetained interests:\nChange in fair value of AIA securities,\nincluding realized gain in 2012\n-\n-\n2,069\nNM\nNM\nChange in fair value of ML III\n-\n-\n2,888\nNM\nNM\nConsolidation and eliminations\n-\n(75)\nNM\nTotal Corporate and Other pre-tax operating income (loss)\n(388)\n(319)\n4,005\n(22)\nNM\n(a) Includes $263 million of severance expense attributable to Property Casualty and Personal Insurance operating segments.\n(b) Represents our share of AerCap’s pre-tax operating income, which excludes certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft.\nItem 7 / results of operations / Corporate and other\n(c) During 2014, the Life Insurance Companies sold their investment in PICC Group to AIG Parent.\nDirect Investment Book Results\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nDIB pre-tax operating income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower fair value appreciation on asset-backed security (ABS) collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and declines in net credit valuation adjustments on assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, partially offset by lower interest expense on borrowings resulting from redemptions and repurchases of DIB debt in 2014.\nFair value appreciation on ABS CDOs was $789 million and $954 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The fair value appreciation on the ABS CDOs was higher in 2013, driven primarily by improved collateral pricing due to more significant improvements in home price indices and amortization of the underlying collateral.\nNet credit valuation adjustment gains of $291 million and $444 million were recognized in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease resulted primarily from lower gains on assets due to more significant widening of counterparty credit spreads in 2014 compared to 2013.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nDIB pre-tax operating income increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by a decline in net credit valuation adjustments on assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.\nFair value appreciation on ABS CDOs was $954 million in 2013 driven primarily by improved collateral pricing due to improvements in home price indices and amortization of the underlying collateral.\nNet credit valuation adjustment gains of $444 million and $789 million were recognized in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the portfolio size due to sales and maturities as well as lower gains on assets due to less significant tightening of counterparty credit spreads, partially offset by lower losses on liabilities due to less significant tightening of AIG’s credit spreads in 2013 compared to 2012.\nThe following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the DIB (excluding intercompany transactions):\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nCounterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets:\nOther bond securities\n$\n$\n$\n1,401\nLoans and other assets\n-\nIncrease in assets\n1,430\nAIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities:\nNotes and bonds payable\n(29)\n(88)\n(526)\nGuaranteed Investment Agreements\n(1)\n(81)\nOther liabilities\n(1)\n(7)\n(34)\nIncrease in liabilities\n(31)\n(54)\n(641)\nNet increase to pre-tax operating income\n$\n$\n$\nItem 7 / results of operations / Corporate and other\nGlobal Capital Markets Results\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nGCM’s pre-tax operating income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to declines in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio and declines in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities, partially offset by gains realized upon unwinding certain positions and a decrease in operating expenses. As previously disclosed in prior quarters, a state regulatory agency has requested additional information relating to the unwinding of a position on which we realized gains of $196 million in 2014.\nUnrealized market valuation gains on the CDS portfolio of $256 million and $550 million were recognized in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline resulted primarily from amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio.\nNet credit valuation adjustment losses of $98 million were recognized in 2014 compared to net credit valuation adjustment gains of $195 million in the prior year. The decline resulted primarily from the recognition of credit valuation losses on derivative assets in 2014 due to higher exposure of uncollateralized derivative assets compared to credit valuation gains on uncollateralized derivative assets in the prior year due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nGCM’s pre-tax operating income increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decline in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior CDS portfolio and an increase in operating expenses.\nNet credit valuation adjustment gains of $195 million were recognized in 2013 compared to net credit valuation adjustment losses of $30 million in 2012. The improvement resulted primarily from lower losses on derivative liabilities due to less significant tightening of AIG’s credit spreads in 2013 compared to 2012 and higher gains on derivative assets due to more significant tightening of counterparty credit spreads in 2013 compared to 2012.\nUnrealized market valuation gains on the CDS portfolio of $550 million and $617 million were recognized in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decline resulted primarily from amortization, price movements, terminations and maturities within the CDS portfolio.\nRun-off Insurance Lines Results\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nRun-off insurance lines reported a pre-tax operating loss of $445 million in 2014 compared to income of $403 million in 2013, primarily as a result of a $407 million charge from a decrease in reserve discount in 2014 compared to a $631 million benefit from an increase in discount in 2013. This discounting-related charge was partially offset by a $98 million decrease in net adverse prior year loss reserve development and an improvement in current accident year loss experience, particularly in the environmental liability business (2004 and prior). The discount charge was primarily due to the decline in risk free rates during 2014 used under Pennsylvania and Delaware prescribed or permitted practices, change in payout pattern assumptions, including the effect of commutations and accelerated settlements for the certain Excess Workers’ Compensation reserves, as well as accretion. See Insurance Reserves - Discounting of Reserves for additional information.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nRun-off insurance lines reported pre-tax operating income of $403 million in 2013 compared to a loss of $135 million in 2012, primarily as a result of a $631 million benefit in reserve discount compared to a $37 million charge in 2012, partially offset by a $98 million increase in net adverse prior year loss reserve development. The discount benefit was primarily due the use of permitted practices from state regulators to use payout patterns specific to the excess workers compensation reserves and a discount rate based on the forward U.S Treasury curve plus a liquidity premium (as opposed to the previously prescribed discount factors.\nItem 7 / results of operations / Corporate and other\nOther Businesses\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nOther businesses’ pre-tax operating income improved in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in gains on investments in life settlements resulting from higher net death benefits.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nOther businesses’ pre-tax operating loss in 2013 was essentially flat compared to 2012.\nAIG Parent and Other Results\n2014 and 2013 Comparison\nAIG Parent and Other’s pre-tax operating losses decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our share of AerCap’s pre-tax operating income, which is accounted for under the equity method, and lower interest expense from ongoing debt management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources, partially offset by an increase in general operating expenses.\nGeneral operating expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of centralizing processes to lower-cost locations and increased costs related to investments in technology.\n2013 and 2012 Comparison\nAIG Parent and Other reported an increase in pre-tax operating losses in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to severance charges and higher general operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to various debt management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nGeneral operating expenses increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher incentive compensation costs. In addition, 2012 included reductions in expenses of $211 million resulting from the decrease in the estimate of the liability for the Department of the Treasury’s underwriting fees in connection with sales of AIG Common Stock.\nRetained Interests\nChange in Fair Value of AIA Securities Prior to Their Sale\nWe sold our remaining 33 percent interest in AIA ordinary shares for proceeds of $14.5 billion and a net gain of $2.1 billion through three sale transactions on March 7, September 11, and December 20, 2012.\nChange in Fair Value of ML III Prior to Liquidation\nThe gains attributable to AIG’s interest in ML III for 2012 were based in part on the completion of the final auction of ML III assets by the FRBNY, in the third quarter of 2012.\nItem 7 / INVESTMENTS\nInvestments\nOverview\nOur investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for Non-Life Insurance Companies, Life Insurance Companies, and AIG Parent including the DIB. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.\nInvestments Highlights in 2014\n· A decrease in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities, partially offset by the widening of spreads, resulted in net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 from approximately $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2013.\n· We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in commercial mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.\n· Net investment income benefitted from positive performance on fixed maturity securities for which we elected the fair value option, primarily driven by lower interest rates as well as income on alternative investments, which continued to benefit from equity market performance.\n· Blended investment yields on new Non-Life and Life Insurance Companies’ investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.\n· Other-than-temporary impairments remained at low levels.\n· The sale of ILFC to AerCap resulted in AIG receiving a 46 percent ownership interest in the outstanding common stock of AerCap, which is included in Other invested assets and accounted for under the equity method.\nInvestment Strategies\nInvestment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.\nSome of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n• Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in Non-Life Insurance Companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.\n• Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Non-Life Insurance Companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n• While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability matching in Life Insurance Companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable.\n• AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate term investment-\nItem 7 / INVESTMENTS\ngrade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate term, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\nInvestments by Legal Entity\nThe following tables summarize the composition of AIG's investments by legal entity:\nNon-Life\nLife\nConsolidations\nInsurance\nInsurance\nCorporate\nand\n(in millions)\nCompanies\nCompanies\nand Other\nEliminations\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2014\nFixed maturity securities:\nBonds available for sale, at fair value\n$\n92,942\n$\n164,527\n$\n5,933\n$\n(3,543)\n$\n259,859\nOther bond securities, at fair value\n1,733\n2,785\n15,634\n(440)\n19,712\nEquity securities:\nCommon and preferred stock available for sale, at fair value\n4,241\n-\n4,395\nOther Common and preferred stock, at fair value\n-\n-\n1,049\nMortgage and other loans receivable, net of allowance\n6,686\n20,874\n(3,274)\n24,990\nOther invested assets\n10,372\n11,916\n12,109\n34,518\nShort-term investments\n4,154\n2,131\n5,827\n(869)\n11,243\nTotal investments*\n120,623\n202,383\n40,765\n(8,005)\n355,766\nCash\n1,191\n-\n1,758\nTotal invested assets\n$\n121,814\n$\n202,834\n$\n40,881\n$\n(8,005)\n$\n357,524\nDecember 31, 2013\nFixed maturity securities:\nBonds available for sale, at fair value\n$\n97,202\n$\n158,225\n$\n7,282\n$\n(4,435)\n$\n258,274\nOther bond securities, at fair value\n1,995\n2,406\n18,558\n(336)\n22,623\nEquity securities:\nCommon and preferred stock available for sale, at fair value\n3,574\n-\n3,656\nOther Common and preferred stock, at fair value\n-\nMortgage and other loans receivable, net of allowance\n4,088\n19,209\n(3,382)\n20,765\nOther invested assets\n9,339\n13,026\n6,398\n(104)\n28,659\nShort-term investments\n5,420\n6,462\n10,882\n(1,147)\n21,617\nTotal investments*\n121,816\n199,946\n44,070\n(9,404)\n356,428\nCash\n1,496\n-\n2,241\nTotal invested assets\n$\n123,312\n$\n200,530\n$\n44,231\n$\n(9,404)\n$\n358,669\n* At December 31, 2014, approximately 90 percent and 10 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities, respectively, compared to approximately 89 percent and 11 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2013.\nThe following table presents the components of Net Investment Income:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nInterest and dividends\n$\n13,246\n$\n13,199\n$\n13,544\nAlternative investments\n2,624\n2,803\n1,769\nOther investment income*\n5,634\nInvestment expenses\n(517)\n(548)\n(604)\nTotal net investment income\n$\n16,079\n$\n15,810\n$\n20,343\n* Includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and which are used to economically hedge the interest rate risk in GMWB embedded derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the net investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $260 million, $(161) million and $37 million, respectively.\nNet investment income for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily due to positive performance on bonds where we elected the fair value option, driven by movements in interest rates, partially offset by lower income on alternative investments\nItem 7 / INVESTMENTS\ndue to equity market performance and lower reinvestment yields on our fixed maturity securities portfolio due to the low interest rate environment.\nNet investment income for 2013 decreased compared to 2012 primarily due to fair value gains from our investments in ML II, ML III and AIA prior to their sale in 2012.\nNon-Life Insurance Companies\nFor the Non-Life Insurance Companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the Non-Life Insurance Companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.\nThe Non-Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the Non-Life Insurance Companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.\nIn addition, the Non-Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds and hedge funds. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio. The Non-Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, equity securities and other yield-enhancing investments.\nWith respect to non-affiliate over-the-counter derivatives, the Non-Life Insurance Companies conduct business with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. The Non-Life Insurance Companies have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. The Non-Life Insurance Companies generally use ISDA Master Agreements and CSAs with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures.\nFixed maturity investments of the Non-Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.3 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns, as well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.\nFixed maturity investments held in the Non-Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and short to intermediate duration, averaging 3.3 years.\nLife Insurance Companies\nThe investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability matching and available investment opportunities.\nThe Life Insurance Companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life Insurance Companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to largely match the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific\nItem 7 / INVESTMENTS\ncharacteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses.\nThe Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.\nIn addition, the Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. The Life Insurance Companies investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, equity securities and yield enhancing items.\nThe Life Insurance Companies monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. The Life Insurance Companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for their new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price attractive guaranteed return products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\nFixed maturity investments of the Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 6.62 years, are comprised of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non-agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings.\nFixed maturity investments held in the Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and intermediate duration, averaging 12.68 years.\nNAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities\nThe Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of Life Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments - Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings.\nItem 7 / INVESTMENTS\nThe following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of Life Insurance Companies categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:\nDecember 31, 2014\n(in millions)\nTotal\nTotal\nBelow\nInvestment\nInvestment\nNAIC Designation\nGrade\nGrade\nTotal\nOther fixed maturity securities\n$\n48,633\n$\n61,428\n$\n110,061\n$\n4,817\n$\n2,372\n$\n$\n$\n7,562\n$\n117,623\nMortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized\n42,370\n1,598\n43,968\n1,468\n45,436\nTotal*\n$\n91,003\n$\n63,026\n$\n154,029\n$\n5,290\n$\n2,540\n$\n$\n$\n9,030\n$\n163,059\n* Excludes $4.3 billion of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC Designation is available because they are not held in legal entities within Life Insurance Companies that require a statutory filing.\nThe following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of Life Insurance Companies categorized by composite AIG credit rating, at fair value:\nDecember 31, 2014\n(in millions)\nTotal\nTotal\nBelow\nInvestment\nCCC and\nInvestment\nComposite AIG Credit Rating\nAAA/AA/A\nBBB\nGrade\nBB\nB\nLower\nGrade\nTotal\nOther fixed maturity securities\n$\n48,550\n$\n61,875\n$\n110,425\n$\n4,354\n$\n2,538\n$\n$\n7,198\n$\n117,623\nMortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized\n26,240\n2,893\n29,133\n1,470\n1,613\n13,220\n16,303\n45,436\nTotal*\n$\n74,790\n$\n64,768\n$\n139,558\n$\n5,824\n$\n4,151\n$\n13,526\n$\n23,501\n$\n163,059\n* Excludes $4.3 billion of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC Designation is available because they are not held in legal entities within Life Insurance Companies that require a statutory filing.\nCredit Ratings\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 90 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 17 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.\nA significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2014, approximately 17 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately five percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 44 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.\nComposite AIG Credit Ratings\nWith respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The “Non-rated” category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.\nItem 7 / INVESTMENTS\nSee Enterprise Risk

For 2014, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $7.3 billion due to a decrease in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities, partially offset by the widening of spreads.\nThe change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in 2013 were primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of bonds available for sale. Net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $13.7 billion primarily due to the increase in U.S. Treasury rates, partially offset by the narrowing of credit spreads and the realization of approximately $2.5 billion in gains from sales of securities.\nSee also Note 6, Investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our investment portfolio.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe following section provides discussion of insurance reserves for both the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies.\nNon-Life Insurance Companies\nThe following section provides discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the Non-Life Insurance Companies.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nThe following table presents the components of AIG’s gross loss reserves by major lines of business on a U.S. statutory basis*:\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\nOther liability occurrence (including asbestos and environmental)\n$\n19,444\n$\n21,023\nInternational\n16,932\n17,126\nWorkers' compensation (net of discount)\n14,914\n15,390\nOther liability claims made\n10,051\n10,645\nProperty\n3,515\n4,111\nAuto liability\n2,237\n2,581\nProducts liability\n1,439\n1,463\nMedical malpractice\n1,626\n1,714\nMortgage guaranty / credit\n1,008\n1,348\nAccident and health\n1,271\n1,378\nCommercial multiple peril\n1,886\n1,886\nAircraft\n1,402\n1,276\nFidelity/surety\nOther\n1,031\n1,068\nTotal\n$\n77,260\n$\n81,547\n* Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the NAIC.\nGross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses, less estimated salvage and subrogation and applicable discount. The Non-Life Insurance Companies regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pre-tax operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development. See MD&A Critical Accounting Estimates - Details of the Loss Reserving Process.\nNet loss reserves represent gross loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance.\nThe following table presents the components of net loss reserves:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nGross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount\n$\n80,337\n$\n85,102\nLess: discount\n(3,077)\n(3,555)\nGross loss reserves, net of discount, before reinsurance\n77,260\n81,547\nLess: reinsurance recoverable*\n(15,648)\n(17,231)\nNet liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n$\n61,612\n$\n64,316\n* Includes $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of reinsurance recoverable under a retroactive reinsurance agreement at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately $12.4 billion and $12.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles (in excess of high dollar amounts retained by the insured through self-insured retentions, deductibles, retrospective programs, or captive arrangements; each referred to generically as “deductibles”), primarily for U.S. commercial casualty business, where the Non-Life Insurance Companies manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured and are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Non-Life Insurance Companies held collateral totaling $9.4 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and assets in trusts.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nThe following table classifies the components of net loss reserves by business unit:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nProperty Casualty:\nCasualty\n$\n33,065\n$\n34,494\nFinancial lines\n9,538\n9,803\nSpecialty\n5,786\n5,485\nProperty\n4,079\n4,293\nTotal Property Casualty (a)\n52,468\n54,075\nMortgage Guaranty\n1,287\nPersonal Insurance\nPersonal lines\n2,763\n3,385\nAccident and health\n1,878\n2,094\nTotal Personal Insurance(a)\n4,641\n5,479\nOther run-off insurance lines\n3,526\n3,475\nNet liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n$\n61,612\n$\n64,316\n(a) The December 31, 2013 balances have been reclassified between the Property Casualty and Personal Insurance lines of business.

New York rules generally do not permit non-tabular discounting on IBNR and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves. Pennsylvania permits non-tabular discounting of IBNR and, commencing in 2013, approved a variable discount rate determined using risk-free rates based on the U.S. Treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin, applicable to IBNR and case reserves. Delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the Pennsylvania domiciled companies.\nThe net reduction in workers’ compensation discount in 2014 of $456 million is primarily due to the decline in risk-free rates during 2014 used under Pennsylvania and Delaware prescribed or permitted practices, changes in the payout pattern assumptions, including the effect of commutations and accelerated settlements for certain excess workers’ compensation reserves, as well as accretion. The change in rates used for discounting was the largest driver of the charge as Treasury rates fell along the entire payout pattern horizon during 2014, and accounted for $397 million of the decrease. The accelerated settlements and commutations in the excess workers’ compensation class of business during 2014 accounted for approximately $111 million of the decrease. The effects of these changes were somewhat offset by increased discount from newly established reserves for accident year 2014 and the impact of the first quarter re-pooling described below.\nOn January 1, 2014, the Non-Life Insurance Companies merged their two internal pooling arrangements into one pool, and changed the participation percentages of the pool members, resulting in a reallocation of reserves from New York domiciled companies to those domiciled in Pennsylvania and Delaware. As a result of these changes in the participation percentages and domiciliary states of the participants of the combined pool, the Non-Life Insurance Companies recognized a discount benefit of $110 million in the first quarter of 2014.\nAnnual Reserving Conclusion\nAIG net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2014. While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of December 31, 2014. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.\nThe following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nNet liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nat beginning of year\n$\n64,316\n$\n68,782\n$\n70,825\nForeign exchange effect\n(1,061)\n(617)\n(90)\nOther, including dispositions\n-\n(79)\n(11)\nChange due to retroactive asbestos reinsurance transaction\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nCurrent year, undiscounted\n21,279\n22,171\n25,385\nPrior years unfavorable development, undiscounted(a)\nChange in discount\n(309)\n(63)\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred(b)\n22,460\n22,419\n25,743\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses paid:\nCurrent year\n6,358\n7,431\n8,450\nPrior years\n17,886\n18,780\n19,325\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses paid(b)\n24,244\n26,211\n27,775\nNet liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nat end of year\n$\n61,612\n$\n64,316\n$\n68,782\n(a) See tables below for details of prior year development by business unit, accident year and major class of business.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\n(b) These amounts exclude benefit from retroactive reinsurance.\nThe following table summarizes development, (favorable) or unfavorable, of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years, net of reinsurance, by business unit and major class of business:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nPrior accident year development by major class of business:\nProperty Casualty - U.S. & Canada:\nExcess casualty\n$\n(36)\n$\n(144)\n$\nFinancial lines including professional liability\n(47)\n(113)\n(283)\nEnvironmental (post 1986 - ongoing)\nPrimary casualty:\nLoss-sensitive (offset by premium adjustments below)\nOther\nHealthcare\n(54)\nProperty excluding natural catastrophes\n(80)\n(95)\nNatural catastrophes\n(102)\n(144)\nAll other, net\nTotal Property Casualty - U.S. & Canada\nProperty Casualty International:\nExcess casualty\n(62)\n(15)\n(10)\nPrimary casualty\n(5)\n(25)\n(36)\nFinancial lines\nSpecialty\n(30)\n(51)\n(77)\nProperty excluding natural catastrophes\n(82)\n(3)\n(54)\nNatural catastrophes\n(77)\n(71)\n(105)\nAll other, net\n(4)\n(14)\n(3)\nTotal Property Casualty - International\n(78)\n(105)\n(252)\nTotal Property Casualty\nMortgage Guaranty\n(104)\n(78)\nConsumer Personal Insurance - U.S. & Canada:\nNatural catastrophes\n(8)\n(69)\nAll other, net\n(44)\n(46)\nTotal Consumer Personal Insurance - U.S. & Canada\n(52)\n(115)\nConsumer Personal Insurance - International:\nNatural catastrophes\n(8)\n-\n(26)\nAll other, net\n(17)\n(40)\n(14)\nTotal Consumer Personal Insurance - International\n(25)\n(40)\n(40)\nTotal Consumer Personal Insurance\n(77)\n(155)\n(20)\nRun-off Insurance Lines - U.S. & Canada:\nAsbestos and environmental (1986 and prior)\nRun-off environmental (1987 to 2004)\nTotal all other, net\n(20)\n-\nTotal Run-off Insurance Lines - U.S. & Canada\nRun-off Insurance Lines - International:\nAsbestos and environmental (1986 and prior)\n(2)\nTotal all other, net\n-\n(12)\nTotal Run-off Insurance Lines - International\n(7)\nTotal Run-off Insurance Lines\nTotal prior year unfavorable development\n$\n$\n$\nPremium adjustments on primary casualty loss sensitive\n(105)\n(89)\n(54)\nTotal prior year development, net of premium adjustments\n$\n$\n$\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nNet Loss Development\nIn determining the loss development from prior accident years, AIG analyzes and evaluates the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a large change, either favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues.\nIn 2014, the adverse prior year loss reserve development, including premium adjustments of $105 million, was $598 million, which was driven by reserve increases on claims in Commercial Insurance and Other - U.S. The net adverse prior year loss reserve development in Commercial Insurance was driven by Primary Casualty, Environmental, International Financial Lines and Healthcare, partially offset by Natural catastrophes, International Primary Casualty and International Commercial Property, while the adverse development in Other - U.S. was driven by adverse development on legacy asbestos and pollution exposures (1986 and prior) and run-off environmental exposures (1987 - 2004). The U.S. Primary Casualty adverse prior year loss reserve development of $445 million was driven by primary General Liability ($182 million), primary Auto Liability ($156 million) and primary Workers’ Compensation ($137 million) due to worse than expected emergence and updated loss development and expected loss ratio assumptions.\nDuring 2013, the adverse prior year loss reserve development including premium adjustments was $468 million. The increase was primarily due to the increases in reserves by $108 million for Storm Sandy, $219 million for U.S. construction primary general liability lines and $238 million for the run-off environmental (1987 to 2004) book.\nIn addition, we recognized additional premiums on loss sensitive business of $105 million, $89 million and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which entirely offset adverse development in that business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred reinsurance reinstatement premiums of ($2) million, compared to $27 million for 2013 and $0 for 2012.\nThe following is a discussion of the primary reasons for the development in 2014, 2013 and 2012 of those classes of business that experienced significant prior accident year development during the three-year period. See MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates for a description of our loss reserving process.\nExcess Casualty - U.S.\nThe excess casualty class presents unique challenges for estimating the unpaid losses. Insureds are generally required to provide notice of claims that exceed a threshold, either expressed as a proportion of the attachment (e.g., 50 percent of the attachment) or for particular types of claims (e.g., death, quadriplegia). This threshold is generally established well below our attachment point, to provide us with a precautionary notice of claims that could potentially pierce our layer of coverage. This means that the majority of claims close without payment because the claims never pierce our layer, while the claims that close with payment can be large and highly variable. Thus, estimates of unpaid losses carry significant uncertainty. For reserve reporting purposes, we combine the Umbrella Excess casualty business with the high layer Catastrophic Casualty business that attaches when losses exceed $50 million.\nDuring 2014, Excess Casualty experienced $36 million of favorable development largely driven by savings on a few large claims. In our Excess Umbrella analysis in 2014, our revised segmentation led to lower 2005 and subsequent accident year estimates for non-mass tort claims where we expect underwriting actions and reductions in policy limits to have a favorable effect on ultimate losses from accident years 2007 to 2013 in particular. This was entirely offset by higher selected ultimate losses for accident years 2004 and prior as a result of updated loss development patterns for mass tort claims which we segmented separately from the non-mass tort claims.\nDuring 2013, Excess Casualty experienced $144 million of favorable emergence due to favorable outcomes on some large cases from 2010 and lower than expected emergence in high layer Catastrophic Casualty business.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nDuring 2012, the Excess Casualty class of business experienced $157 million of adverse development based on worse than expected Umbrella Excess emergence, primarily from adverse outcomes relating to certain large claims from older accident years, from the legacy public entity excess casualty class of business and from a refined analysis applied to claims in excess of $10 million. This refined analysis considered the impact of changing attachment points (primarily impacting frequency of excess claims) and limit structures (primarily impacting severity of excess claims) throughout the loss development period.\nEnvironmental and Pollution Products\nWe maintain an active environmental insurance business related to pollution legal liability and general liability for environmental consultants and engineers, as well as run-off business for certain environmental coverage which provides cost overrun protection, in some cases over long time periods. We evaluate and report reserves associated with this business separately from the 1986 and prior asbestos and environmental reserves associated with standard General Liability and Umbrella policies discussed under “Asbestos and Environmental Reserves”.\nHistorically, we had used traditional actuarial methods to assess the reserves for pollution products. The comprehensive claims review process that began in 2012 provided a more refined approach for the development of actuarial estimates for toxic tort claims (which were found to have a distinctly lengthier loss development pattern than other general liability claims in the environmental portfolio) as well as a more appropriate methodology for incorporating case reserving based estimates of ultimate loss costs for complex claims involving environmental remediation and/or from policies with high policy limits (greater than $5 million per policy). Notwithstanding the refined methodology and approach applied in 2012 and subsequently, considerable uncertainty remains over the ultimate loss costs for this class of business, especially for business written in accident years 2003 and prior.\nIn 2014, our updated analysis of environmental and pollution products resulted in adverse prior year loss reserve development of $120 million for pollution policies primarily written prior to 2004, which are managed by our run-off unit, and $91 million for pollution policies written 2004 and subsequent. The prior year loss reserve development on policies written prior to 2004 is mostly due to projected increases for individual claim estimates as determined by our run-off unit. The prior year loss reserve development on policies written in 2004 and subsequent is due to an increase in the pure IBNR by reflecting an increase in the estimated future severity for the pure IBNR claims and an increase in the expected loss ratios for recent years to reflect the emerging experience and the results of updated claim file reviews completed in 2014. Our updated reviews did not establish any discernible trends from a policy structure, industry class, or cause of loss standpoint. Rather, there were several large loss increases associated with a single accident or catastrophe. While the average policy term for new business written is close to three years, the results for more recent accident years can still be influenced by longer term policies issued in prior years. We have continued to actively monitor and adjust policy terms offered in the pollution products class of business. Transactions with policy terms greater than five years have been reduced by more than 75 percent, with policy terms in excess of five years now accounting for just four percent of the gross written premiums of the book. The new business written continues to meet risk adjusted profitability targets after the increased estimates of ultimate losses for the more recent accident years.\nIn 2013, our analysis of pollution products reflected an updated review of individual cases which indicated large increases in the value of certain previously reported cases due to new developments such as the discovery of additional contamination in certain sites, legislative changes, and court rulings, expansion of plaintiff damages and increased cost of remediation technologies. Additionally, the number and severity of newly reported claims was higher than expected. As a result, we increased our estimate of ultimate losses by approximately $269 million with approximately $201 million of this relating to policies written in 2003 and prior. Significant changes in underwriting during 2004 changed the terms and conditions materially for policies written after 2003 to reduce our exposure to these events.\nBecause of an increase in the frequency and severity of claims observed beginning in 2011, the 2012 loss reserve review consisted of an intensive review of reported claims by a multi-disciplinary team including external specialists in environmental law and engineering science, toxicologists and other specialists, our actuaries, claims managers and underwriters to reassess our indicated loss reserve need. The review improved our understanding of factors that drive claim costs such as policy term, limit, pollution conditions covered, location of incident and applicable laws and remediation standards. The analysis used these factors to segment and analyze the claim data to determine ultimate costs, in some cases, on a claim by claim basis. As a result of this analysis, $200 million of adverse prior year loss reserve development was recognized during 2012, including $166 million for pollution products reported in the run-off unit. The majority (81 percent) of the adverse development related to accident years 2003 and prior, before significant underwriting changes were adopted.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nIn addition to reserving actions, we have made significant changes to the ongoing environmental business included in Commercial Insurance with the goal of ensuring that the current policies are being written to earn an appropriate risk adjusted profit. Underwriting guidelines have been revised to no longer cover known or expected clean up costs, which were a significant driver of historical claims, and a “new emerging contaminants” team has been formed within the dedicated environmental engineering staff to track any new cleanup standards that may be set by federal or state regulators. Further, engineering reviews are required for specific business segments (such as oil and gas, and landfills) that have traditionally generated higher losses.\nPrimary Casualty - U.S. and Canada\nPrimary Casualty includes Workers’ Compensation, General Liability and Auto Liability lines of business. In addition, these lines of business are categorized into classes of business including National Accounts, Commercial Risk, Specialty Workers’ Compensation, Energy, Multi National, Construction, Transportation and Trucking.\nThe National Accounts class of business includes casualty insurance for businesses with revenues of $700 million or more. The Commercial Risk class of business includes casualty insurance for businesses with revenues of less than $700 million. The majority of the business is workers’ compensation. The Specialty Workers’ Compensation class of business includes small monoline guaranteed cost risks. Our Specialty Workers’ Compensation class of business grew significantly in the early to mid 2000s but has reduced premium writings by nearly 70 percent since 2007. The Energy class of business includes casualty insurance (including workers’ compensation) in the mining, oil and gas and power generation sectors. The Construction, Transportation and Trucking class of business includes casualty insurance (including workers’ compensation) within that industry.\nDuring 2014, we continued to refine our segmentation of primary workers’ compensation into guaranteed cost and excess of large deductible business by deductible size group. The net result of the analysis was adverse development of $137 million for the primary workers’ compensation class of business. The key drivers of the adverse development in this class of business were increases for guaranteed cost business in California and New York, and increases for excess of large deductible business, as well as adverse experience in the Construction class. Each of these segments appears to have been impacted by specific structural changes in the portfolio. For California business, our tail factor increases were in response to changing long-term medical development patterns. In New York, there has been a lengthening of the period between the date of accident and the classification of non-scheduled permanent partial injuries. We completed a review of claim emergence and payouts for our top six states in workers’ compensation and concluded that California and New York were the main states where the loss development patterns had materially changed since our last review. For excess of large deductible business across all states, we updated our analyses to consider the impact of changes in the mix of retentions that has occurred over time as the data by retention band was becoming more credible. For the Construction class, we note that the construction sector has experienced a comparatively slow recovery in payroll employment. As a result of the diminished employment opportunities in this industry sector, injured workers may experience limited return-to-work opportunities, which moderate the shortening of claim duration that normally accompanies a labor market recovery. For all other states combined excluding California and New York, we saw favorable emergence in our middle market Specialty Workers’ Compensation segment. The net effect of these revised selections had the greatest adverse effect on the Construction class of business ($140 million adverse development) and the National Accounts class of business ($125 million adverse development). The most significant favorable effect was in the Specialty Workers’ Compensation class of business ($155 million favorable development). Our analysis considers our best estimate expectations of medical inflation and loss costs trends and also reflects the impacts of enhancements in our claim management and loss mitigation activities, such as opioid management, fraud investigation and medical management.\nFor primary general liability in 2014, we increased our ultimate losses for prior years by $182 million. This was largely driven by the construction segment as a result of several large construction defect claims and increases in the costs of claims in New York associated with New York Labor Law. The construction results in California and New York continue to be the main sources of adverse development in our guaranteed cost primary general liability books although we did experience adverse development from construction defect claims in other states in 2014. Our large account primary non-construction general liability business was adversely impacted by claim activity in the layers excess of large insured retentions and we increased our loss development patterns for these layers to reflect the changes.\nFor commercial auto in 2014, we reacted to an increase in frequency of large claims in the accident years 2010 to 2013, where the economic recovery has contributed to increased frequency and severity, especially for those claims in excess of a client\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\ndeductible of $500,000, which generally take several years to emerge and settle. This led to adverse prior year loss reserve development of $156 million for the automobile subset of primary casualty.\nDuring 2013, we continued to refine the segmentation of our analyses of primary workers’ compensation, which indicated that prior year loss reserve development was flat after taking into account the initiatives that our claim function has undertaken to manage high risk claims.\nDuring 2013, for primary general liability, we increased our reserves for prior years by approximately $355 million. Most of the increase was driven by construction-related primary general liability claims, especially construction defect claims where we increased our ultimate loss estimates by $219 million to reflect the higher than expected frequency and severity of these claims especially in states that experienced heavy increases in construction activity after the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes and during the housing boom prior to 2007. Due to the subsequent home price declines observed in many of these states, the frequency of reported losses has increased as the losses subsequently represented a larger percentage of the equity values of the affected homes, and homeowners increasingly looked to insurance recoveries as a way to recoup some of that lost value.\nDuring 2012, we significantly intensified our claims management efforts for those primary workers’ compensation claims which are managed by AIG. These efforts include consulting with various specialists, including clinical and public health professionals and other advisors. We also continued to refine our actuarial methodologies for estimating ultimate loss costs incorporating a more refined segmentation by state (California and New York were analyzed separately) and a more refined approach for business subject to deductibles as well as business subject to premium adjustments (loss-sensitive business). Based on these enhanced reviews, we increased reserves by $46 million.\nIn 2012, we also reviewed the general liability loss experience of the primary casualty classes of business using a more refined segmentation for business subject to a deductible as well as loss-sensitive business. Our review focused on applying actuarial loss development analyses to those general liability claims for which these techniques are appropriate. As a result of this analysis, we determined that prior year reserves needed to be increased by $235 million for the primary general liability class of business in 2012 to reflect the worse than expected emergence of paid loss severities for both bodily injury and property damage claims from the more recent accident years (2008 and subsequent).\nHealthcare\nDuring 2014, we recognized $109 million of adverse development in this class largely driven by three large and relatively unusual claims of $25 million each in relatively recent accident years. While there have not been any significant structural changes to the portfolio, there can be material volatility in loss experience in this class of business where individual claims can be of high severity.\nDuring 2013, this class recognized $54 million of favorable prior year development due to lower than expected loss emergence in many classes such as Excess Hospital Liability.\nDuring 2012, this class recognized $68 million of adverse prior year loss reserve development due to several large claims that involved unusual coverage issues for this class. With the exception of these claims, this class experienced claim activity in line with expectations.\nFinancial Lines - U.S. and Canada\nFinancial Lines business includes Director and Officer (D&O) and Related Management Liability, including various Professional Liability classes of business as well as the Fidelity book of business. The Financial Lines book consists mostly of the D&O class of business.\nDuring 2014, we recognized $47 million of favorable development driven by the Professional Liability and D&O and Related Management Liability classes of business, somewhat offset by adverse development on the Fidelity book in recent accident years due to the changing economic cycle.\nDuring 2013, we recognized $113 million of favorable development driven somewhat evenly among the Professional Liability, Fidelity and D&O and Related Management Liability classes of business. The year-end 2013 Professional Liability loss reserve actuarial review adopted a refined segmentation for this class of business with the selection of differentiated frequency and\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nseverity trends for various Professional Liability classes of business which appear to be behaving differently in the post financial crisis years than when reviewed in total.\nDuring 2012, we recognized $283 million of favorable development in these classes of business largely driven by the D&O and Related Management Liability classes of business. For the year-end 2012 loss reserve review, our actuaries took into account the favorable emergence during 2012 for several accident years, especially accident year 2010, the claims department’s reviews of open claims and reduced the ultimate losses for prior accident years accordingly. The 2012 D&O and Related Management Liability actuarial review also used a refined segmentation for this class of business with the selection of differentiated frequency and severity trends. The overall loss cost used for this class of business in 2012 from the application of the refined segmentation was slightly lower than that adopted for the 2011 review reflecting the continued favorable emergence from the class of business\nFinancial Lines - International\nOur Global Financial Lines Claims unit has implemented its target operating model in Europe and Australasia which has provided our actuaries with more detailed case reserve data and analysis, enabling AIG’s actuaries to react sooner to case development than in prior reserve studies. The actuaries see evidence of earlier settlement of claims on a paid and incurred basis in the International Financial Lines class of business. During 2014, we recognized $182 million of adverse development in the international Financial Lines segments, driven by large claims emergence in the U.K., Australasia and Europe. Multiple accident years contributed to this total, but it was concentrated most heavily in accident years 2008-2011. The Australasia emergence was due to a number of specific large losses in the Australia and New Zealand D&O business. In Europe, adverse prior year loss reserve development was concentrated in the D&O class of business, where we have observed a greater incidence of severe claims compared with prior years, and the Professional class of business, with large losses from one insured. The new business written across International Financial Lines continues to meet risk adjusted profitability targets after the increased estimates of ultimate losses for the more recent accident years.\nDuring 2013, we recognized $74 million of adverse development, all of which stemmed from losses in the D&O books in Europe, UK and Australasia, with the other segments showing modest favorable development. The development we recognized can be directly linked to a small number of specific claims booked throughout the year.\nDuring 2012, we recognized $33 million of adverse development, concentrated in Europe and Australasia D&O, which was related to a small number of specific severe claims in those regions.\nExcess Workers’ Compensation - U.S.\nThis class of business, which is reported in our run-off unit, has an extremely long tail and is one of the most challenging classes of business to reserve for, particularly when the excess coverage is provided above a self-insured retention layer. The class is highly sensitive to small changes in assumptions - in the rate of medical inflation or the longevity of injured workers, for example - which can have a significant effect on the ultimate reserve estimate.\nDuring 2014, we updated our analyses of Excess Workers compensation using a range of scenarios and methodologies and determined that our carried reserves were adequate after recognizing $20 million of favorable prior year development as a result of claim settlements and commutations of assumed reinsurance business, as well as reflecting changes in estimates in our loss mitigation strategies. We commuted several large assumed reinsurance agreements in 2014 and reduced the reserves faster than was previously expected as a result of our proactive management by the run-off unit. The reduction in nominal reserves as a result of assumed reinsurance commutations and individual claims settlement strategies amounted to $242 million in 2014, compared to $25 million in 2013. The results from these strategies also impacted the loss payout patterns used in our discount calculations, previously discussed.\nDuring 2013, we updated our analysis of Excess Workers’ Compensation reserves and determined that no changes to our carried reserves were needed. We also updated our analysis of underlying claims cost drivers used in 2012 through accident year 2004, discussed in more detail below.\nDuring the 2012 loss reserve review, we augmented traditional reserve methodologies with an analysis of underlying claims cost drivers to inform our judgment of the ultimate loss costs for open reported claims from accident years 2003 and prior\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\n(representing approximately 95 percent of all open reported claims) and used the refined analysis to inform our judgment of the ultimate loss cost for claims that have not yet been reported using a frequency/severity approach for these accident years.\nThis approach was deemed to be most suitable for injured workers whose medical conditions had largely stabilized (i.e., at least 9 to 10 years have elapsed since the date of injury). The reserves for accident years 2004 and subsequent (13 percent of total case and IBNR reserves for this class) were determined using traditional methods.\nNatural Catastrophes\nDuring 2014, we experienced favorable property catastrophe prior year development of $102 million in our U.S. and Canada business, primarily due to several U.S. events in accident year 2013. We also experienced favorable property catastrophe prior year loss reserve development of $77 million from our international property class of business.\nDuring 2013, we experienced adverse development from Storm Sandy totaling $108 million, or 5.4 percent of the 2012 estimate. This development resulted from higher severities on a small number of large and complex commercial claims driven by a number of factors including the extensive damage caused to properties in the downtown New York metropolitan area.\nDuring 2012, we experienced favorable development from the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan due to commercial claim severities being less than previously reserved.\nInternational Casualty\nDuring 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had $67 million, $40 million, and $46 million of favorable development, respectively. The favorable development in each year is due to lower than expected loss emergence in many classes and countries outside the U.S., with the majority from various countries in the EMEA region.\nPersonal Insurance\nDuring 2014, we experienced favorable loss reserve development of $16 million from Natural Catastrophes, primarily related to Storm Sandy. The remaining $61 million of favorable development is primarily from Homeowners, International Accident & Health and U.S. Warranty.\nMortgage Guaranty\nMortgage Guaranty business includes domestic first liens (93 percent of total reserves) and small run-off books in second liens, student loans and international.\nDuring 2014, we recognized $104 million of favorable prior year loss reserve development driven in part by steady increases in year-over-year first lien cure rates, a reflection of the improved economic environment, and in part by favorable frequency trends and recoveries in second lien claims. Partially offsetting these improvements were upward trends in severity, particularly for older (pre-2012) accident periods.\nDuring 2013, we recognized $30 million of adverse prior year loss reserve development due to unfavorable emergence of overturns of prior claim cancellations and increased severity estimates in first liens, partially offset by favorable frequency in student loans and a reduction in the unallocated loss adjustment expense reserve.\nDuring 2012, we recognized $78 million of favorable prior year loss reserve development due to higher than expected cancellation rates on first lien legacy claims, combined with improving frequency trends and strong recoveries in second lien claims.\nSee Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for further discussion of our loss reserving process.\nSee Commercial Insurance and Consumer Personal Insurance Results herein for further discussion of net loss development.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nThe following table summarizes development, (favorable) or unfavorable, of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for prior years, net of reinsurance, by accident year:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nPrior accident year development by accident year:\nAccident Year\n$\n(283)\n$\n-\n$\n-\n(59)\n(181)\n-\n(162)\n(350)\n(75)\n(45)\n(1)\n(150)\n(113)\n-\n(75)\n(20)\n2004 and prior (see table below)\nTotal prior year unfavorable development\n$\n$\n$\nNet Loss Development by Accident Year\nFor 2014, the favorable development in accident years 2013 and 2012 was driven by Financial Lines, Commercial Property and other short tailed lines, like Personal Lines. For accident year 2007, the favorable development was driven by U.S. and Canada Financial lines and Excess Casualty. For accident years 2004 and prior, the adverse development was driven by the Excess Casualty results of the mass-tort resegmentation analysis, the updated primary workers’ compensation loss development selections (principally in California, New York and the excess of deductible segments) as well as the run-off pollution products business (1987-2004) and the asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior) exposure.\nFor 2013, the favorable development from accident year 2012 was driven primarily by consumer lines and lower losses in domestic commercial property, while the favorable development from accident year 2010 was primarily the result of favorable claims emergence from domestic excess casualty and from liability and financial lines coverage policies that are on a claims made basis. The adverse development from accident year 2011 was driven by large losses in financial lines and adverse development in primary casualty, including the loss-sensitive business. The adverse development from accident year 2009 was driven by large losses in financial lines and adverse development in primary casualty including loss-sensitive business. For the same periods, the adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior was primarily driven by loss development on toxic tort claims, construction general liability claims and pollution product claims.\nFor 2012, the favorable development from accident year 2011 was driven primarily by the favorable development on natural catastrophes, primarily the Tohoku Catastrophe, and the adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior was primarily the result of the increase in reserves on runoff pollution product business (policies written between 1987 and 2003).\nFor certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to AIG. These reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables above.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nThe following table summarizes development, (favorable) or unfavorable, of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for accident year 2004 and prior by major class of business and driver of development:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2004 and prior accident year development by major class of business and\ndriver of development:\nExcess Casualty - primarily mass torts(a)\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nExcess Casualty - all other\n(108)\nPrimary Casualty - loss sensitive business(b)\n(24)\nPrimary Casualty - all other(c)\nEnvironmental (post 1986 - ongoing) and Run-off environmental (1987 to 2004)(d)\nAsbestos and Environmental (1986 and prior)\nCommutations(e)\nAll Other\nTotal prior year unfavorable development\n$\n$\n$\n(a) Updates of mass tort loss development patterns.\n(b) Loss sensitive business that is offset by premium adjustments and has no income statement impact.

Commutations are reflected for the years in which they were contractually binding.\nThe main sources of unfavorable prior year development for accident years 2004 and prior, representing 95 percent of the total recorded in 2012 through 2014, are as follows:\n• Update of the mass tort loss development patterns used for U.S. Excess Casualty which accounted for $301 million and other loss emergence including specific large loss development totaling $196 million across the three years;\n• Loss sensitive business that is entirely offset by premium adjustments accounted for $96 million;\n• Update of the loss development patterns used for U.S. Primary Casualty including loss development patterns used in guaranteed cost workers’ compensation in CA and NY, the construction class of business and updates to the loss development patterns for business written on excess of deductible exposures in workers’ compensation, general liability and the commercial auto classes of business which collectively accounted for approximately $577 million across the three years;\n• Update of the Environmental run-off portfolio’s losses following the 2012 comprehensive claims review that provided a more refined approach for the development of actuarial estimates for toxic tort claims (which were found to have a distinctly lengthier loss development pattern than other general liability claims in the environmental portfolio) as well as a more appropriate methodology for incorporating case reserving based estimates of ultimate loss costs for complex claims involving environmental remediation and/or from policies with high policy limits (greater than $5 million per policy). These updates which commenced in 2012 and have been applied in each subsequent year, accounted for approximately $561 million;\n• Update of our net retained asbestos and environmental exposure from 1986 and prior which accounted for approximately $266 million ($196 million environmental and $70 million asbestos) across the three years; and\n• Commutations in the three-year period ending December 31, 2014, accounted for approximately $162 million. These commutations serve to reduce the uncertainty in AIG’s required reserves.\nDuring the period 2012 to 2014, we completed comprehensive refinements of our reserving methodologies for U.S. mass tort, toxic tort, retained asbestos, environmental and other specific large losses. We also conducted extensive additional studies to corroborate our judgments for our U.S. primary workers compensation and excess workers’ compensation classes of business. Further, we refined our loss reserving methodologies for our U.S. Excess Casualty class of business and our U.S. Primary Casualty class of business written over excess of deductible exposures where loss development patterns may lengthen if client retentions increase over time. Collectively, the reserves for the aforementioned classes of business or loss exposures account for the majority of the remaining net loss reserves for accident years 2004 and prior.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nAsbestos and Environmental Reserves\nLoss Reserve Estimates - Asbestos and Environmental\nWe consider a number of factors and recent experience, in addition to the results of both external and internal analyses, to estimate asbestos and environmental loss reserves. Nonetheless, we believe that significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims, which is due to several factors, including:\n• the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, leading to the potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims;\n• claims filed under the non-aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies;\n• the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcies;\n• diverging legal interpretations; and\n• the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various parties with respect to environmental claims.\nIn 2014, both the retained accounts and retroceded account ground-up reviews for asbestos were updated. As a result, we decreased gross undiscounted asbestos loss reserves by $6 million and increased net undiscounted asbestos loss reserves by $64 million. The net undiscounted increase reflects a buyout settlement on a retained account as well as a reduction in estimated ceded loss reserves (prior to the retroactive reinsurance retrocession). For environmental, we increased gross environmental reserves by $140 million and net environmental reserves by $60 million as a result of top-down actuarial analyses performed during the year as well as development on a number of large accounts.\nIn 2013, we completed a ground-up review of all our remaining retained accounts for asbestos. In addition, a subsidiary of the retrocessionaire for our retroactive reinsurance contract completed a ground-up asbestos study for the largest accounts it assumed. As a result, we increased gross asbestos loss reserves by $169 million and net asbestos loss reserves by $6 million. The net reserve increase also reflects a small amount of estimated uncollectible reinsurance. A significant portion of these loss reserves will be recoverable under our retroactive reinsurance arrangement. For environmental, we increased gross environmental reserves by $98 million and net environmental reserves by $61 million as a result of top-down actuarial analyses performed during the year as well as development on a number of large accounts.\nIn 2012, after considering recent experience compared to the results of our most recent ground-up analysis, as well as all of the above factors related to uncertainty, no adjustment to gross and net asbestos reserves was recognized. Additionally in 2012, a moderate amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount is reflected in the table below and is related to the reserves not subject to our retroactive reinsurance agreement. Upon completion of a top-down analysis performed for environmental in the fourth quarter of 2012, we concluded that the $150 million gross reserve strengthening and $75 million net reserve strengthening recognized in the first half of 2012 was adequate.\nIn addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, the Non - Life Insurance Companies also have asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non-U.S. entities of $132 million gross and $105 million net as of December 31, 2014. The asbestos reserves relating to non-U.S. risks written by non-U.S. entities were $134 million gross and $108 million net as of December 31, 2013.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nThe following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims:\nAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nGross\nNet\nGross\nNet\nGross\nNet\nAsbestos:\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nat beginning of year\n$\n4,720\n$\n$\n4,896\n$\n$\n5,226\n$\nChange in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:\nPaid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts\n-\n-\n-\nRe-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive\nreinsurance contracts(a)\n-\n(4)\n-\n(91)\n-\n(21)\nChange in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance\n-\n-\n-\nDispositions\n-\n-\n(12)\n(12)\n(10)\n(10)\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nUndiscounted\n(6)\n-\nChange in discount\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred(b)\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses paid(b)\n(636)\n(368)\n(444)\n(59)\n(404)\n(227)\nOther changes\n-\n-\n-\n-\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nat end of year\n$\n4,117\n$\n$\n4,720\n$\n$\n4,896\n$\nEnvironmental:\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nat beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nDispositions\n-\n-\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses paid\n(85)\n(38)\n(93)\n(60)\n(44)\n(30)\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nat end of year\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nCombined:\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nat beginning of year\n$\n5,033\n$\n$\n5,205\n$\n$\n5,430\n$\nChange in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:\nPaid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts\n-\n-\n-\nRe-estimation of amount recoverable under retroactive\nreinsurance contracts\n-\n(4)\n-\n(91)\n-\n(21)\nChange in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance\n-\n-\n-\nDispositions\n-\n-\n(13)\n(13)\n(11)\n(11)\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nUndiscounted\nChange in discount\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses paid\n(721)\n(406)\n(537)\n(119)\n(448)\n(257)\nOther changes\n-\n-\n-\n-\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nat end of year\n$\n4,485\n$\n$\n5,033\n$\n$\n5,205\n$\n(a) Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts includes effect of changes in reserve estimates and changes in discount.\n(b) These amounts exclude benefit from retroactive reinsurance.\nTransfer of Domestic Asbestos Liabilities Under a Retroactive Reinsurance Arrangement\nOn June 17, 2011, we completed a transaction under which the bulk of AIG Property Casualty’s net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. This was part of our ongoing strategy to reduce our overall loss reserve development risk. This transaction covers potentially volatile U.S.-\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nrelated asbestos exposures. It does not, however, cover asbestos accounts that we believe have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries.\nUpon the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, we ceded the bulk of AIG Property Casualty’s net domestic asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Within this aggregate limit, NICO assumed collection risk for existing third-party reinsurance recoverable associated with these liabilities. AIG Property Casualty paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net U.S. asbestos liabilities. As a result of this transaction, AIG Property Casualty recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into income over the settlement period of the underlying claims.\nUnder retroactive reinsurance arrangements any recoveries for development associated with the ceded losses are not recognized immediately; rather this development increases or decreases the deferred gain, and is amortized into income as described above. During 2013, we recognized approximately $86 million of adverse loss development that was ceded under this reinsurance arrangement, which was partially offset by $15 million of deferred gain amortization. This development, net of the deferred gain amortization, is being reported in Other income/expense, consistent with the way we manage the business and assess performance and is therefore excluded from net losses incurred and our loss ratios to avoid distortion related to our ongoing insurance business.\nThe following table presents the estimate of the gross and net IBNR included in the Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, relating to asbestos and environmental claims:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nGross\nNet*\nGross\nNet*\nGross\nNet*\nAsbestos\n$\n2,363\n$\n$\n3,190\n$\n$\n3,193\n$\nEnvironmental\nCombined\n$\n2,520\n$\n$\n3,284\n$\n$\n3,268\n$\n* Net IBNR includes the reduction due to the NICO reinsurance transaction of $803 million, $1,284 million and $1,310 million as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nThe following table presents a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity:\nAs of or for the Years\nEnded December 31,\nAsbestos\nEnvironmental\nCombined\nAsbestos\nEnvironmental\nCombined\nAsbestos\nEnvironmental\nCombined\nClaims at beginning of year\n4,680\n1,517\n6,197\n5,230\n1,614\n6,844\n5,443\n3,782\n9,225\nClaims during year:\nOpened\nSettled\n(216)\n(163)\n(379)\n(194)\n(154)\n(348)\n(254)\n(179)\n(433)\nDismissed or otherwise\nresolved(a)\n(545)\n(240)\n(785)\n(439)\n(249)\n(688)\n(185)\n(2,211)\n(2,396)\nOther(b)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nClaims at end of year\n4,049\n1,240\n5,289\n4,680\n1,517\n6,197\n5,230\n1,614\n6,844\n(a) The number of environmental claims dismissed or otherwise resolved, increased substantially during 2012 as a result of Non-Life Insurance Companies determination that certain methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) claims presented no further potential for exposure since these underlying claims were resolved through dismissal, settlement, or trial for all of the accounts involved. All of these accounts were fully reserved at the account level and included adequate reserves for those underlying individual claims that contributed to the actual losses. These individual claim closings, therefore, had no impact on Non-Life Insurance Companies environmental reserves.\n(b) Represents an administrative change to the method of determining the number of open claims, which had no effect on carried reserves.\nSurvival Ratios - Asbestos and Environmental\nThe following table presents AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would take before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments.\nMany factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resulting survival ratio. Additionally, we primarily base our determination of these reserves based on ground-up and top-down analyses, and not on survival ratios.\nItem 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\nThe following table presents survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:\nYears Ended December 31,\nGross\nNet*\nGross\nNet*\nGross\nNet*\nSurvival ratios:\nAsbestos\n8.3\n7.6\n10.6\n10.5\n9.6\n8.7\nEnvironmental\n5.0\n4.3\n4.6\n3.9\n4.5\n4.4\nCombined\n7.9\n7.1\n9.8\n9.4\n9.0\n8.1\n* Survival ratios are calculated consistent with the basis on historical reserve excluding the effects of the NICO reinsurance transaction.\nLife Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves\nThe following section provides discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance reserves for Life Insurance Companies.\nDAC\nThe following table summarizes the major components of the changes in Life Insurance Companies DAC, including VOBA:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n6,920\n$\n5,815\n$\n6,607\nAcquisition costs deferred\n1,114\n1,034\nAmortization expense:\nUnlocking included in pre-tax operating income\nRelated to realized capital gains and losses\n(23)\n(23)\n(119)\nAll other operating amortization\n(887)\n(780)\n(890)\nIncrease (decrease) in DAC due to foreign exchange\n(32)\n(39)\n(14)\nOther change in DAC(a)\n-\n-\nChange related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments\n(360)\n(621)\nBalance, end of year(b)\n$\n7,258\n$\n6,920\n$\n5,815\n(a) Other change in DAC in 2014 included (i) VOBA related to the acquisition of Ageas Protect and (ii) an increase in DAC due to a change to include interest income on assets supporting certain non-traditional insurance liabilities in the determination of estimated gross profits used to amortize both DAC and URR. The increase in the DAC asset, which principally reflected the impact of the change on periods prior to 2014, was substantially offset by a related increase in the URR liability.\n(b) DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $8.7 billion, $8.0 billion and $7.7 billion at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nUpdate of Actuarial Assumptions\nPre-tax operating income in 2014, 2013 and 2012 reflected the net effect of adjustments to update actuarial assumptions for the domestic Life Insurance Companies. These adjustments included unlocking of estimated gross profit assumptions for investment-oriented products as well as loss recognition expense to increase reserves for certain traditional blocks of business. See Critical Accounting Estimates - Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products, Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts, Unlocking of Estimated Gross Profits below, and Loss Recognition below, for additional discussion of the process and results related to assumption changes.\nItem 7 / Insurance reserves / Life Insurance companies\nThe following table presents the increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income resulting from the update of actuarial assumptions for the domestic Life Insurance Companies, by product line:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nUnlocking of estimated gross profit assumptions:\nConsumer Insurance:\nRetirement\nFixed Annuities\n$\n$\n$\nRetirement Income Solutions\n(28)\n-\nGroup Retirement\n(45)\nTotal Retirement\nLife\n(32)\n(80)\n(43)\nCommercial Insurance:\nInstitutional Markets\n-\n-\nTotal increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income from unlocking of estimated\ngross profit assumptions\nLoss recognition*:\nConsumer Insurance - Life\n(87)\n-\n(67)\nTotal increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income from update of assumptions\n$\n$\n$\n(26)\n* Excludes loss recognition expense that was attributable primarily to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization, which was excluded from pre-tax operating income and reported within changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses).\nEstimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products\nPolicy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing contracts for investment-oriented products are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and URR) are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\nUnlocking of Estimated Gross Profit Assumptions\nThe Life Insurance Companies review and update estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for investment-oriented products at least annually. The increases (decreases) to pre-tax operating income and pre-tax income of these assumption updates by product line and financial statement line item, respectively, are shown in the following tables. These adjustments do not include loss recognition on certain long-term care products; see Loss Recognition below for additional discussion of the update of assumptions for certain long-term care products.\nIn 2014, pre-tax operating income of the Life Insurance Companies in aggregate increased by $216 million as a result of the update of estimated gross profit assumptions, the most significant of which was a net positive adjustment in Fixed Annuities, primarily due to better investment spreads than previously assumed.\nA net positive adjustment in the Retirement Income Solutions product line in 2014 was primarily due to improved mortality assumptions. Additional adjustments in the Retirement Income Solutions product line, related to assumptions used to value reserves and DAC for GMWB features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value, were recorded in net realized capital gains (losses). Adjustments reported in net realized capital gains (losses), and in change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses), are included in the table of adjustments by reported line item below, and are not reflected in pre-tax operating income.\nA net positive adjustment in the Group Retirement product line in 2014 was primarily due to more favorable assumptions for investment spreads and surrender rates than previously assumed.\nItem 7 / Insurance reserves / Life Insurance companies\nA net negative adjustment in the Life product line in 2014 was due to lower investment spread and higher mortality assumptions than previously assumed. The updated mortality assumptions are still within pricing assumptions.\nIn 2013, pre-tax operating income of the Life Insurance Companies in the aggregate increased by a net positive adjustment of $153 million as a result of update of estimated gross profit assumptions, primarily due to a net positive adjustment in the Fixed Annuities product line in 2013, as a result of active spread management of crediting rates and higher future investment yields than those previously assumed.\nNet negative adjustments in the Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines in 2013 resulted primarily from the update of variable annuity spreads and surrender rates. In Group Retirement, these negative adjustments were partially offset by an increase in the assumption for separate account asset long-term growth rates under our reversion to the mean methodology. A negative adjustment in the Life product line resulted from the update of mortality assumptions.\nIn 2012, pre-tax operating income of the Life Insurance Companies in aggregate increased by a net positive adjustment of $41 million as a result of the update of estimated gross profit assumptions. The net positive adjustment in 2012 was primarily due to improved surrender assumptions for fixed annuities, partially offset by lower yield and spread assumptions for universal life and for certain blocks of fixed annuities.\nThe following table presents the increase (decrease) in pre-tax income resulting from the unlocking of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits of the domestic Life Insurance Companies, by line item as reported in Results of Operations:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nPolicy fees\n$\n$\n$\nInterest credited to policyholder account balances\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\nPolicyholder benefits and losses incurred\n(84)\n(67)\n(74)\nIncrease in pre-tax operating income\nChange in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses)\n(12)\n(21)\n-\nNet realized capital gains (losses)\n-\nIncrease in pre-tax income\n$\n$\n$\nThe net adjustments to DAC amortization from the unlocking of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented two percent and one percent of the DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe increases in net realized capital gains (losses) in 2014 and 2013, which were partially offset by adjustments to change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses), reflected updated mortality assumptions for GMWB embedded derivative liabilities in Retirement Income Solutions.\nReversion to the Mean\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, we revised the growth rate assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period for the Group Retirement product line in our Retirement segment, because annual growth assumptions indicated for that period had fallen below our floor of zero percent due to the favorable performance of equity markets. This adjustment increased Retirement pre-tax operating income by $35 million in 2013. For variable annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions product line, the assumed annual growth rate has remained above zero percent for the five-year reversion to the mean period and therefore has not met the criteria for adjustment; however, additional favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in unlocking in this product line in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking. See Critical Account Estimates - Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies) for additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology.\nItem 7 / Insurance reserves / Life Insurance companies\nDAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nDAC for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC as if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow DAC). The change in shadow DAC generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio. In addition, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves). The increase in the Life Insurance Companies’ unrealized appreciation of investments in 2014 of $5.9 billion, which was driven by the decline in market interest rates, resulted in a decrease in shadow DAC and an increase in shadow loss reserves in 2014. Shadow loss reserves were insignificant at December 31, 2013 and increased to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014. In 2013, shadow DAC increased and shadow loss reserves decreased due to an increase in market interest rates. The change in shadow DAC and shadow loss reserves in 2014 was greater than the change in 2013, due to a larger movement in unrealized appreciation of investments.\nLife Insurance Companies Reserves\nThe following table presents a rollforward of Life Insurance Companies’ insurance reserves, including separate accounts and mutual fund assets under management, by operating segment:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nInstitutional Markets:\nBalance at beginning of year, gross\n$\n32,100\n$\n32,242\n$\n31,378\nPremiums and deposits\n3,797\nSurrenders and withdrawals\n(766)\n(2,620)\n(1,128)\nDeath and other contract benefits\n(1,530)\n(1,371)\n(1,384)\nSubtotal\n1,501\n(3,000)\n(1,738)\nChange in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of\npolicy fees\n1,130\n1,156\nCost of funds\nOther reserve changes\n(61)\n1,289\n1,155\nBalance at end of year\n35,080\n32,100\n32,242\nReserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments\n1,054\n-\n2,359\nReinsurance ceded\n(5)\n(5)\n(9)\nTotal insurance reserves\n$\n36,129\n$\n32,095\n$\n34,592\nRetirement:\nBalance at beginning of year, gross\n$\n195,493\n$\n173,281\n$\n164,127\nPremiums and deposits\n24,077\n23,788\n16,159\nSurrenders and withdrawals\n(20,504)\n(16,459)\n(14,809)\nDeath and other contract benefits\n(3,690)\n(3,353)\n(3,506)\nSubtotal\n(117)\n3,976\n(2,156)\nChange in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of\npolicy fees\n6,390\n14,482\n7,785\nCost of funds\n2,781\n2,837\n3,127\nOther reserve changes\nBalance at end of year\n204,627\n195,493\n173,281\nReserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments\n-\nReinsurance ceded\n(353)\n(366)\n(377)\nTotal insurance reserves and mutual fund assets under management\n$\n204,374\n$\n195,127\n$\n173,360\nLife:\nBalance at beginning of year, gross\n$\n32,810\n$\n32,176\n$\n31,354\nPremiums and deposits\n4,806\n4,862\n4,864\nSurrenders and withdrawals\n(853)\n(896)\n(1,001)\nDeath and other contract benefits\n(812)\n(772)\n(878)\nSubtotal\n3,141\n3,194\n2,985\nChange in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of\npolicy fees\n(691)\n(673)\n(473)\nCost of funds\nOther reserve changes\n(2,231)\n(2,428)\n(2,200)\nBalance at end of year\n33,536\n32,810\n32,176\nReserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments\n-\n-\n-\nReinsurance ceded\n(1,315)\n(1,354)\n(1,375)\nTotal insurance reserves\n$\n32,221\n$\n31,456\n$\n30,801\nTotal Life Insurance Companies:\nBalance at beginning of year, gross\n$\n260,403\n$\n237,699\n$\n226,859\nPremiums and deposits\n32,680\n29,641\n21,797\nSurrenders and withdrawals\n(22,123)\n(19,975)\n(16,938)\nDeath and other contract benefits\n(6,032)\n(5,496)\n(5,768)\nSubtotal\n4,525\n4,170\n(909)\nChange in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of\npolicy fees\n6,829\n14,965\n8,188\nCost of funds\n3,698\n3,791\n4,208\nOther reserve changes\n(2,212)\n(222)\n(647)\nBalance at end of year\n273,243\n260,403\n237,699\nReserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments\n1,154\n-\n2,815\nReinsurance ceded\n(1,673)\n(1,725)\n(1,761)\nTotal insurance reserves and mutual fund assets under management\n$\n272,724\n$\n258,678\n$\n238,753\nItem 7 / Insurance reserves / Life Insurance companies\nLife Insurance Companies insurance reserves including separate accounts and mutual fund assets under management were comprised of the following balances:\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\nFuture policy benefits*\n$\n40,931\n$\n38,849\nPolicyholder contract deposits\n124,716\n122,038\nSeparate account liabilities\n80,025\n71,048\nTotal insurance reserves\n245,672\n231,935\nMutual funds assets under management\n27,052\n26,743\nTotal insurance reserves and mutual fund assets under management\n$\n272,724\n$\n258,678\n* Excludes certain intercompany assumed reinsurance.\nLoss Recognition\nOther reserve changes in the table above include loss recognition expense. Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments include shadow loss reserves. Loss recognition expense attributable primarily to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization was excluded from pre-tax operating income and reported within changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses) in Results of Operations - Consumer Insurance. See Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts for additional discussion of loss recognition.\nThe Life operating segment recorded loss recognition expense of $87 million in 2014 and $67 million in 2012, which reduced pre-tax operating income in the respective periods, to increase reserves for certain long-term care business. The 2014 loss recognition was primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, to a lesser extent, lower yield assumptions. The 2012 loss recognition reflected updated assumptions for morbidity and lower premium increases. Assumptions related to investment yields, mortality experience and expenses are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which could also result in additional loss recognition reserves. While the domestic Life Insurance Companies do not currently offer standalone long-term care products, these needs are addressed with various benefits and riders in the existing portfolio, such as chronic illness riders.\nItem 7 / Insurance reserves / Life Insurance companies\nSales of investment securities in connection with the program to utilize capital loss carryforwards and other investment sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered loss recognition expense, primarily on certain long-term payout annuity contracts in the Institutional Markets and Retirement segments, of $30 million in 2014, $1.5 billion in 2013 and $1.2 billion in 2012, which was not reflected in pre-tax operating income.\nShadow loss reserves of the Life Insurance Companies were not significant at December 31, 2013 and increased to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in unrealized appreciation of investments during the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and stressed markets. See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\nCapital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\nWe believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\nNevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\nDepending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited, to repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Activity for 2014\nSources\n• AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries(a)\nDuring 2014, AIG Parent received $2.6 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Non-Life Insurance Companies and $6.8 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies, which included approximately $829 million of legal settlement proceeds.\nAIG Parent also received a net amount of $1.0 billion in tax sharing payments from our insurance businesses in 2014, reflecting $57 million in net reimbursements to our insurance businesses during the fourth quarter of 2014. The tax sharing payments may be subject to further adjustment in future periods.\n· Debt Issuances(b)\nOn July 16, 2014, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.300% Notes due 2019 and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Notes due 2044.\nOn October 15, 2014, we issued an additional $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Notes due 2044.\n· Legal Settlement\nIn July 2014, we received $650 million in cash in connection with the global resolution of our residential mortgage-related disputes with Bank of America.\n· ILFC Sale\nOn May 14, 2014, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion from the sale of ILFC after taking into account the settlement of intercompany loans. This cash amount is in addition to the 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares we received as consideration from the sale.\nUses\n• Debt Reduction\nDuring 2014, we reduced DIB debt by approximately $7.5 billion, in each case, using cash allocated to the DIB, through the following:\n• On January 17, 2014, a redemption of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.250% Notes due 2014;\n• In January 2014, repurchases of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 8.250% Notes due 2018;\n• On May 5, 2014, a redemption of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.000% Notes due 2015;\n• On July 31, 2014, a redemption of $790 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% Notes due 2016;\n• On July 31, 2014, a redemption of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% Notes due 2017;\n• On October 27, 2014, a redemption of approximately $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 8.250% Notes due 2018;\n• In October and November 2014, total repurchases of approximately $410 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.450% Medium-Term Notes, Series MP, Matched Investment Program due 2017; and\n• On December 24, 2014, a repurchase of approximately $73 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.000% Notes due 2015.\nOn July 14, 2014, we purchased, in cash tender offers, (i) certain junior subordinated debentures issued or guaranteed by AIG for an aggregate purchase price of $1.8 billion and (ii) certain senior notes and debentures issued or guaranteed by AIG for an aggregate purchase price of $700 million. In October and December 2014, we repurchased approximately $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.175% Series A-6 Junior Subordinated Debentures.\nWe also made other repurchases and repayments of approximately $5.1 billion during 2014. AIG Parent made interest payments on our debt instruments totaling $1.6 billion during 2014.\n• Dividend\nWe paid a cash dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock during each quarter of 2014.\n• Repurchase of Common Stock\nWe repurchased approximately 88 million shares of AIG Common Stock during 2014, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of those shares, reflect our payment of approximately $3.1 billion in the aggregate under five ASR agreements and the receipt of approximately 53 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 9.2 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR agreement executed in December 2014.\n• Legal Settlement\nOn October 22, 2014, we made a cash payment of $960 million, which is being held in escrow pending final approval of the settlement of the Consolidated 2008 Securities Class Action. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\n(a) In January 2015, we received $2.2 billion in additional dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies and, in February 2015, we received $600 million in additional cash dividends from our Non-Life Insurance Companies. These dividends had been declared during the three-month period ended December 31, 2014.\n(b) On January 15, 2015, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Notes due 2035 and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Notes due 2055.\nAnalysis of Sources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2014*\nSources:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n5,007\n5,865\n3,676\nNet cash provided by changes in restricted cash\n-\n1,244\nNet cash provided by other investing activities\n15,731\n5,855\n16,198\nChanges in policyholder contract balances\n1,719\n-\n-\nIssuance of long-term debt\n6,687\n5,235\n8,612\nNet cash provided by other financing activities\n-\n-\n4,251\nTotal sources\n29,144\n18,199\n33,151\nUses:\nChange in restricted cash\n(1,447)\n-\n-\nChange in policyholder contract balances\n-\n(547)\n(690)\nRepayments of long-term debt\n(16,160)\n(14,197)\n(11,101)\nRepayment of Department of Treasury SPV Preferred Interests\n-\n-\n(8,636)\nPurchases of AIG Common Stock\n(4,902)\n(597)\n(13,000)\nNet cash used in other financing activities\n(7,132)\n(1,652)\n-\nTotal uses\n(29,641)\n(16,993)\n(33,427)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n(74)\n(92)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash\n(571)\n1,114\n(260)\n* For 2014, cash decreased by $162 million due to reclassification of $289 million to restricted cash presented in Other assets, partially offset by $127 million reclassification from Short-term investments, to correct prior period presentation.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nThe following table presents a summary of AIG’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nSummary:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n5,007\n$\n5,865\n$\n3,676\nNet cash provided by investing activities\n14,284\n7,099\n16,612\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(19,788)\n(11,758)\n(20,564)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n(74)\n(92)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash\n(571)\n1,114\n(260)\nCash at beginning of year\n2,241\n1,151\n1,474\nChange in cash of businesses held for sale\n(24)\n(63)\nCash at end of year\n$\n1,758\n$\n2,241\n$\n1,151\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nInterest payments totaled $3.4 billion in 2014, compared to $3.9 billion in 2013 and $4.0 billion in 2012. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $8.3 billion, $9.7 billion and $7.7 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nInsurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.\nCash provided by operating activities of our Non-Life Insurance Companies was $0.9 billion in 2014 compared to $0.4 billion in 2013 and $1.1 billion in 2012, primarily reflecting the timing of the payments related to catastrophe losses in each year.\nCash provided by operating activities of our Life Insurance Companies was $4.4 billion in 2014, $4.3 billion in 2013 and $2.9 billion in 2012. The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income and higher proceeds from legal settlements with financial institutions that participated in the creation, offering and sale of RMBS from which our Life Insurance Companies realized losses during the financial crisis.\nCash provided by operating activities of businesses held for sale was $2.9 billion for each of 2013 and 2012.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2014 reflected:\n• a reduction in net investment purchase activity; and\n• approximately $2.4 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ILFC.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for 2013 included an increase in net investment purchase activity.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for 2012 includes:\n• payments received relating to the sale of the underlying assets held by ML II of approximately $1.6 billion;\n• payments of approximately $8.5 billion received in connection with the dispositions of ML III assets by the FRBNY; and\n• gross proceeds of approximately $14.5 billion from the sale of AIA ordinary shares.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2014 includes:\n• approximately $712 million in the aggregate to pay dividends of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the four quarters of 2014;\n• approximately $4.9 billion to repurchase approximately 88 million shares of AIG Common Stock;\n• approximately $271 million to repay long-term debt of business held-for-sale; and\n• approximately $16.2 billion to repay long-term debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2013 includes:\n• approximately $294 million in the aggregate to pay dividends of $0.10 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2013;\n• approximately $597 million to repurchase approximately 12 million shares of AIG Common Stock;\n• approximately $9.3 billion to repay long term debt; and\n• approximately $4.9 billion in repayments of long term debt of business held-for-sale.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2012 includes:\n• $8.6 billion to pay down the Department of the Treasury’s preferred interests (AIA SPV Preferred Interests) in the special purpose vehicle holding the AIA ordinary shares; and\n• total payments of approximately $13.0 billion for the purchase of shares of AIG Common Stock.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries\nAIG Parent\nAs of December 31, 2014, AIG Parent had approximately $14.3 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. AIG Parent liquidity sources are monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs.\nWe generally manage capital flows between AIG Parent and its subsidiaries through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\nWe believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nWe utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our core insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.\nIn the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our core insurance operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available for distribution to shareholders. Additionally, it is expected that capital associated with businesses or investments that do not directly support our core insurance operations may be available for distribution to shareholders or deployment towards liability management upon its monetization.\nIn developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the capital resources available to support our core insurance operations and business strategies, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, expectations for capital generation, rating agency expectations for capital, as well as regulatory standards for capital and capital distributions.\nThe following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:\nAs of\nAs of\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2014\nDecember 31, 2013\nCash and short-term investments(a)(b)\n$\n5,085\n$\n10,154\nUnencumbered fixed maturity securities(c)\n4,727\n2,968\nTotal AIG Parent liquidity\n9,812\n13,122\nAvailable capacity under syndicated credit facility(d)\n4,000\n3,947\nAvailable capacity under contingent liquidity facility(e)\nTotal AIG Parent liquidity sources\n$\n14,312\n$\n17,569\n(a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $1.6 billion and $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n(b) $2.9 billion and $5.9 billion of cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are allocated toward future maturities of liabilities and contingent liquidity stress needs of DIB and GCM.\n(c) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds.\n(d) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility, see Credit Facilities below.\n(e) For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facility, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below.\nNon-Life Insurance Companies\nWe expect that our Non-Life Insurance Companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.\nCertain Non-Life Insurance Companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs may be used to supplement liquidity. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, none of our Non-Life Insurance Companies had FHLB borrowings outstanding.\nOur Non-Life Insurance Companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nAIG Parent and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL), a Non-Life Insurance Company, are parties to a $625 million letter of credit facility. ACNL, as a member of the Lloyd’s of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd’s), is required to hold capital at Lloyd’s, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). The entire FAL capital requirement of $625 million as of December 31, 2014, which supports the 2014 and 2015 years of account, was satisfied with a letter of credit issued under the facility.\nAIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our Non-Life Insurance Companies through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with a Mortgage Guaranty insurance company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk-to-capital ratio. In addition, the CMA provides that if capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital, subject to its board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws, this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital. As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. As of December 31, 2014, the minimum required capital for the CMA with the Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is based on a risk-to-capital ratio of 19 to 1.\nAIG Parent was also party to a consolidated CMA with AIG Property Casualty Inc. and certain domestic Non-Life Insurance Companies. Among other things, the CMA provided that AIG Parent would maintain the total adjusted capital of these Non-Life Insurance Companies, measured as a group (the Fleet), at or above the specified minimum percentage of the Fleet’s projected total authorized control level RBC. As a result of managing capital through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines, AIG Parent agreed with AIG Property Casualty Inc. and these domestic Non-Life Insurance Companies to terminate this CMA effective February 19, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, the specified minimum percentage in the CMA with AIG Property Casualty Inc. and these domestic Non-Life Insurance Companies was 300 percent.\nIn 2014, our Non-Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $2.6 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent. The fixed maturity securities included investment-grade government, corporate and sovereign bonds, as well as agency RMBS. In 2014, our Non-Life Insurance Companies also paid other non-cash dividends of $178 million to AIG Parent. In addition, our Non-Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $600 million of cash dividends to AIG Parent in February 2015, which represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by our Non-Life Insurance Companies in the fourth quarter of 2014. AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions pursuant to the CMAs.\nLife Insurance Companies\nWe expect that our Life Insurance Companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our Life Insurance Companies liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.\nCertain of our domestic Life Insurance Companies are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our domestic Life Insurance Companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of $44 million and $50 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe need to fund product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities creates a potential liquidity requirement for our Life Insurance Companies. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life Insurance Companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. As part of their risk management framework, our Life Insurance Companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Our Life Insurance Companies also have developed a contingent liquidity plan to address unforeseen liquidity needs.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nCertain of our domestic Life Insurance Companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these domestic Life Insurance Companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life Insurance Company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. There were no outstanding securities lent under these programs by our domestic Life Insurance Companies as of December 31, 2014. The liability of our Life Insurance Companies to borrowers for collateral received was zero as of December 31, 2014 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2013.\nAIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our Life Insurance Companies through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of AGC Life Insurance Company at or above a specified minimum percentage of its projected NAIC Company Action Level Risk-Based Capital (RBC), which as of December 31, 2014, was 250 percent. As a result of managing capital through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines, AIG Parent agreed with certain other domestic Life Insurance Companies to terminate their CMAs effective October 31, 2014.\nDividends and loan repayments from our domestic Life Insurance Companies to AIG Parent in 2014 totaled $7.4 billion, which was comprised of $6.8 billion of cash and fixed maturity securities and $642 million of preferred equity interests in two aircraft trust entities, and included approximately $829 million of legal settlement proceeds. The fixed maturity securities included investment-grade government, corporate and sovereign bonds, as well as agency RMBS. In addition, our domestic Life Insurance Companies paid $2.2 billion in dividends and loan repayments, in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities, to AIG Parent in January 2015, which represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by our domestic operating Life Insurance Companies in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOther Operations\nDirect Investment Book\nThe DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives. We are focused on meeting the DIB’s liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the DIB, without relying on resources beyond the DIB. As part of this program management, we may from time to time access the capital markets, including issuing and repurchasing debt, and selling assets on an opportunistic basis, in each case subject to market conditions. If the DIB’s risk target is breached, we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the DIB’s liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.\nFrom time to time, we may utilize cash allocated to the DIB that is not required to meet the risk target for the DIB for general corporate purposes unrelated to the DIB.\nThe DIB’s assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, U.S. government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities. The value of these assets is impacted by macro-economic trends in U.S. and core European markets, including corporate credit spreads, commercial and residential real estate markets, and to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, among other factors. The majority of these assets are carried at fair value. The DIB’s liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short-term financing obligations. The DIB has both liabilities held at cost and liabilities held at fair value. The liabilities held at fair value vary in price based on changes in AIG’s credit spreads. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the DIB had total assets of $15.1 billion and $23.3 billion, respectively, and total liabilities of $9.7 billion and $20.0 billion, respectively.\nThe overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets, liabilities and operating results of GCM and is not included within the DIB’s assets, liabilities or operating results.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nCollateral posted by operations included in the DIB to third parties was $3.5 billion at December 31, 2014 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2013. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.\nGlobal Capital Markets\nDerivative transactions between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties are generally centralized through GCM, specifically through AIG Markets. GCM is required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). To the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation, GCM is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing organization and GCM’s clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants. To the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation, these derivative transactions are governed by bilateral master agreements, the form of which is published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA). Many of these agreements, primarily between GCM and third party financial institutions, require collateral postings. Many of GCM’s transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements, the purpose of which are to provide collateral to GCM, which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties, including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants.\nIn addition, most of GCM’s CDSs within AIGFP are subject to collateral posting provisions. The collateral posting provisions contained in the ISDA Master Agreements and related transaction documents with respect to CDSs differ among counterparties and asset classes. The amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior CDSs is a function of our credit ratings, the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with market value being the most significant factor. We estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior CDSs using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions.\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, GCM had total assets of $4.5 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, and total liabilities of $3.1 billion as of both dates. GCM’s assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, other receivables, net of allowance, and unrealized gains on swaps, options and forwards. GCM’s liabilities consist primarily of unrealized losses on swaps, options and forwards. Collateral posted by GCM to third parties was $3.0 billion at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. GCM obtained collateral from third parties totaling $1.1 billion and $572 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under ISDA Master Agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date.\nCredit Facilities\nWe maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Five-Year Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Five-Year Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.0 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2014, a total of $4.0 billion remains available under the Five-Year Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility would restrict our access to the Five-Year Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Five-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nContingent Liquidity Facilities\nAIG Parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to $500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Under this facility, we have the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG Parent and the counterparty.\nOur ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:\nDecember 31, 2014\nPayments due by Period\nTotal\n2016 -\n2018 -\n(in millions)\nPayments\nThereafter\nInsurance operations\nLoss reserves\n$\n80,424\n$\n21,612\n$\n24,154\n$\n12,248\n$\n22,410\nInsurance and investment contract liabilities\n226,219\n13,870\n27,617\n24,705\n160,027\nBorrowings\n-\n-\n-\nInterest payments on borrowings\n1,430\n1,110\nOperating leases\n1,169\nOther long-term obligations\nTotal\n$\n310,085\n$\n35,860\n$\n52,313\n$\n37,302\n$\n184,610\nOther\nBorrowings\n$\n26,656\n$\n1,980\n$\n5,149\n$\n4,722\n$\n14,805\nInterest payments on borrowings\n16,363\n1,288\n2,359\n1,755\n10,961\nOperating leases\nOther long-term obligations\n-\nTotal\n$\n43,388\n$\n3,309\n$\n7,655\n$\n6,508\n$\n25,916\nConsolidated\nLoss reserves\n$\n80,424\n$\n21,612\n$\n24,154\n$\n12,248\n$\n22,410\nInsurance and investment contract liabilities\n226,219\n13,870\n27,617\n24,705\n160,027\nBorrowings\n27,476\n1,980\n5,149\n4,722\n15,625\nInterest payments on borrowings\n17,793\n1,352\n2,487\n1,883\n12,071\nOperating leases\n1,304\nOther long-term obligations(a)\nTotal(b)\n$\n353,473\n$\n39,169\n$\n59,968\n$\n43,810\n$\n210,526\n(a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures.\n(b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.4 billion, the timing of which is uncertain.\nLoss Reserves\nLoss reserves relate to our Non-Life Insurance Companies and represent future losses and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our Non-Life Insurance Companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.\nInsurance and Investment Contract Liabilities\nInsurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life Insurance Companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nnature. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.\nWe have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe believe that our Life Insurance Companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life Insurance Companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.\nBorrowings\nOur borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:\nDecember 31, 2014\nAmount of Commitment Expiring\nTotal Amounts\n2016 -\n2018 -\n(in millions)\nCommitted\nThereafter\nInsurance operations\nGuarantees:\nStandby letters of credit\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nGuarantees of indebtedness\n-\n-\nAll other guarantees(a)\n-\n-\nCommitments:\nInvestment commitments(b)\n2,238\n1,730\n-\nCommitments to extend credit\n1,695\nLetters of credit\n-\n-\n-\nTotal(c)\n$\n4,979\n$\n2,624\n$\n1,433\n$\n$\nOther\nGuarantees:\nLiquidity facilities(d)\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nStandby letters of credit\n-\n-\nAll other guarantees\n-\n-\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nCommitments:\nInvestment commitments(b)\nCommitments to extend credit(f)\n1,002\n-\n1,000\n-\nLetters of credit\n-\n-\n-\nOther commercial commitments(e)\n-\nTotal(c)\n$\n1,616\n$\n$\n$\n1,031\n$\nConsolidated\nGuarantees:\nLiquidity facilities(d)\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nStandby letters of credit\n1,067\nGuarantees of indebtedness\n-\n-\nAll other guarantees(a)\n-\nCommitments:\nInvestment commitments(b)\n2,490\n1,795\nCommitments to extend credit(f)\n2,697\n1,468\nLetters of credit\n-\n-\n-\nOther commercial commitments(e)\n-\nTotal(c)\n$\n6,595\n$\n2,939\n$\n1,520\n$\n1,597\n$\n(a) Includes construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments by our Life Insurance Companies. Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on indemnification obligations.\n(b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.\n(c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.\n(d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.\n(e) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The annual pension contribution for 2015 is expected to be approximately $173 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.\n(f) Includes a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap Ireland Capital Limited, as borrower, and AIG Parent, as lender (the AerCap Credit Facility). The AerCap Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment of $1.0 billion and permits loans for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under the AerCap Credit Facility.\nArrangements with Variable Interest Entities\nWe enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIndemnification Agreements\nWe are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nDebt\nThe following table provides the rollforward of AIG’s total debt outstanding:\nBalance at\nMaturities\nEffect of\nBalance at\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nDecember 31,\nand\nForeign\nOther\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nIssuances\nRepayments\nExchange\nChanges\nDebt issued or guaranteed by AIG:\nAIG general borrowings:\nNotes and bonds payable\n$\n14,062\n$\n3,247\n$\n(1,508)\n$\n(236)\n$\n$\n15,570\nSubordinated debt\n-\n-\n-\n-\nJunior subordinated debt\n5,533\n-\n(2,986)\n(81)\n-\n2,466\nLoans and mortgages payable\n-\n(1)\n-\n-\n-\nAIGLH notes and bonds payable\n-\n(15)\n-\n-\nAIGLH junior subordinated debt\n1,054\n-\n(518)\n-\n-\nTotal AIG general borrowings\n21,199\n3,247\n(5,028)\n(317)\n19,106\nAIG/DIB borrowings supported by assets:(a)\nMIP notes payable\n7,963\n-\n(4,781)\n(274)\n(38)\n2,870\nSeries AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable\n3,219\n-\n(2,998)\n-\n(187)\nGIAs, at fair value\n5,530\n(1,675)\n-\n(b)\n4,648\nNotes and bonds payable, at fair value\n1,217\n(338)\n-\n(91)\n(b)\nTotal AIG/DIB borrowings supported by assets\n17,929\n(9,792)\n(274)\n8,370\nTotal debt issued or guaranteed by AIG\n39,128\n3,710\n(14,820)\n(591)\n27,476\nDebt not guaranteed by AIG:\nOther subsidiaries notes, bonds, loans and\nmortgages payable\n(167)\n(5)\n(450)\n(c)\nDebt of consolidated investments(d)\n1,909\n1,450\n(1,160)\n(1)\n1,485\n(c) (e)\n3,683\nTotal debt not guaranteed by AIG\n2,565\n1,474\n(1,327)\n(6)\n1,035\n3,741\nTotal debt\n$\n41,693\n$\n5,184\n$\n(16,147)\n$\n(597)\n$\n1,084\n$\n31,217\n(a) AIG Parent guarantees all DIB debt, except for MIP notes payable and Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable, which are direct obligations of AIG Parent.\n(b) Primarily represents adjustments to the fair value of debt.\n(c) Reflects debt that has been reclassified from Other subsidiaries notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable to Debt of consolidated investments.\n(d) At December 31, 2014, includes debt of consolidated investments held through AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp., AIG Credit Corp., AIGLH and AIG Property Casualty Inc. of $2.0 billion, $54 million, $1.5 billion and $122 million, respectively.\n(e) Includes the effect of consolidating previously unconsolidated securitization vehicles.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nTotal DEBT OUTSTANDING\n(in millions)\nThe decrease in total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 was primarily due to maturities and repayments of debt and redemptions and repurchases of certain debt securities, as discussed above.\nDebt Maturities\nThe following table summarizes maturing debt at December 31, 2014 of AIG (excluding $3.7 billion of borrowings of consolidated investments) for the next four quarters:\nFirst\nSecond\nThird\nFourth\nQuarter\nQuarter\nQuarter\nQuarter\n(in millions)\nTotal\nAIG general borrowings\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n1,097\nAIG/DIB borrowings supported by assets\nOther subsidiaries notes, bonds, loans and\nmortgages payable\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,017\n$\n2,018\nSee Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details for debt outstanding.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings estimate a company’s ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability of financing to that company. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of February 2, 2015. Figures in parentheses indicate the relative ranking of the ratings within the agency’s rating categories; that ranking refers only to the major rating category and not to the modifiers assigned by the rating agencies.\nShort-Term Debt\nSenior Long-Term Debt\nMoody’s\nS&P\nMoody’s(a)\nS&P(b)\nFitch(c)\nAIG\nP-2 (2nd of 3)\nA-2 (2nd of 8)\nBaa 1 (4th of 9)\nA- (3rd of 8)\nBBB+ (4th of 9)\nStable Outlook\nStable Outlook\nStable Outlook\nStable Outlook\nAIG Financial Products Corp.(d)\nP-2\nA-2\nBaa 1\nA-\n-\nStable Outlook\nStable Outlook\nStable Outlook\nAIG Funding, Inc.(d)\nP-2\nA-2\n-\n-\n-\nStable Outlook\n(a) Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to the generic rating categories to show relative position within the rating categories.\n(b) S&P ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.\n(c) Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.\n(d) AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc.\nThese credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request.\nWe are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.\nIn the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other GCM entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other GCM entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other GCM entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.\nThe actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.\nFor a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of our insurance companies or our credit ratings, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Liquidity, Capital and Credit.\nRegulation and Supervision\nFor a discussion of our regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad, including with respect to our liquidity and capital resources, see Item 1. Business - Regulation and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulation.\nItem 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\nDividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock\nOn February 13, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on March 25, 2014 to shareholders of record on March 11, 2014. On May 5, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on June 24, 2014 to shareholders of record on June 10, 2014. On August 4, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on September 25, 2014 to shareholders of record on September 11, 2014. On November 3, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on December 18, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 4, 2014.\nOn February 12, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on March 26, 2015 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2015. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us, as discussed further in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock, with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.0 billion, from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. On February 13, 2014, June 5, 2014 and October 31, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized increases to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of an aggregate of $4.5 billion.\nDuring 2014, we repurchased approximately 88 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion pursuant to this authorization.\nIn the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014, we executed five ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of those shares, each as set forth above, reflect our payment of approximately $3.1 billion in the aggregate to the financial institutions under the ASR agreements and the receipt of approximately 53 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 9.2 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR agreement executed in December 2014. That ASR agreement settled in January 2015, at which time we received approximately 3.5 million additional shares of AIG Common Stock based on a formula specified by the terms of the ASR agreement.\nOn February 12, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $2.5 billion, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization on such date of approximately $2.5 billion. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors.\nDividend Restrictions\nPayments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries.\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nEnterprise Risk Management\nRisk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.\nOverview\nWe have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firm’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM)\n· Our ERM framework provides senior management with a consolidated view of our risk appetite and major risk positions.\n· In each of our business units, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerances within the ERM framework while working with ERM to mitigate risks across the firm.\n· Risk management is an integral part of how we manage our core businesses.\nRisk Governance Structure\nOur risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.\nOur Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. Those committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and AIG’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\nThe Group Risk Committee (GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO. Its membership includes our CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and other executives from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nManagement committees that support the GRC are described below. These committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates.\nFinancial Risk Group (FRG): The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by AIG and its subsidiaries. Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. Membership of the FRG includes our EVP -\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nInvestments, Deputy AIG Chief Investment Officer, as well as our CFO, and other senior executives from Finance and ERM. Our CRO serves as Chair of the FRG.\nTransaction Approval and Business Practices Committee (TABPC): TABPC provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. Our Deputy General Counsel serves as TABPC Chair and additional members include our CRO and CFO, and other senior executives from Finance, Legal, Treasury, Investments and our business units.\nOperational Risk Committee (ORC): This committee oversees operational risk management activities across AIG’s businesses, functions, and geographic locations. The ORC reviews the enterprise-wide identification, escalation and mitigation of operational risks that may arise from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events. The ORC also monitors current and emerging operational risks, as well as management actions taken to reduce risks to acceptable levels. The Committee approves the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy and ORM Framework, which includes the identification, assessment, monitoring and measurement of risks. The Committee ensures applicable governance structures are established to provide oversight of operational risk at each business unit and corporate function. The ORC also reviews aggregate firm-wide operational risk reports and provides a forum for senior management to assess our operational risk profile and to discuss operational risks that may affect our strategic objectives.\nORC members include senior AIG executives with expertise in legal, compliance, technology, human resources, finance and operational risk, as well as business continuity management and the chief risk officers of our business units.\nBusiness Unit Risk and Capital Committees: Each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk and capital committee (BU RCC) that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. The BU RCCs are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, approving capital management strategies (including asset allocation and risk financing), insurance portfolio optimization, risk management policies and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In addition to its BU RCC, each major insurance business has established subordinate committees which identify, assess and monitor the specific operational, transactional and financial risks inherent in its respective business. Together, the BU RCCs and AIG Risk Committees described above provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.\nRisk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement\nRisk Appetite Framework\nOur Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We intend to balance these by taking measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and produce long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our Risk Appetite Statement approved by the Board of Directors\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nor a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\nWe articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. The risk appetite for our insurance operations inform the requirements for capital adequacy for individual legal entities. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\nRisk Limits\nA key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and allows monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder’s expectations. Our objectives include:\n• Monitoring of risks, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability;\n• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance from the group-level to regional entities; and\n• Alignment with Risk Appetite Statement, where applicable.\nTo support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has established a limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n• Level I Limits are AIG consolidated level limits. They define our aggregate maximum exposures for core risks within the boundaries set by the Risk Appetite Statement, and constrain our concentration in specific risk types. These limits are set to manage key risks identified by ERM and to meet requirements by regulators and rating agencies at a consolidated level. Level 1 Limits are reported to the FRG, GRC and RCC.\n• Level II Limits are business unit level limits. They define our appetite for specific, material risk taking activities within business units and corporate functions. These key risks are identified by ERM for the business unit and/or corporate function, and risk limits are developed to meet the specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. Level II Limits are reported to the BU RCC and FRG.\n• Level III Limits monitor risk utilization on the regional or local level and are developed to address any specific requirements by regulators and rating agencies for that region not captured by the Level I and Level II limits. Level 3 Limits are reported at the local entity BU RCC.\nAll limits are reviewed by the FRG, GRC or business unit level risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\nThe business units are responsible for complying with all risk limits. The ERM teams and chief risk officers within each business unit monitor such compliance and provide regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality. Responsibility for addressing and/or remediating any breach rests with individuals within the specific unit that experienced the breach.\nRisk Identification and Measurement\nOne tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our annual integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\ndown to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\nWe employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks. This framework is built on our existing ERM stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations. The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. We develop a range of stress scenarios based both on internal experience and regulatory guidance. The stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources for our insurance company subsidiaries and the consolidated company are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.\nThe stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its statutory capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. Using our stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital and earnings impact of potential stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraint of each business operation. We use this information to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\nWe evaluate and manage risk in material topics as shown below. These topics are discussed in more detail in the following pages:\n• Credit Risk Management\n• Liquidity Risk Management\n• Insurance Operations Risks\n• Market Risk Management\n• Operational Risk Management\n• Other Operations Risks\nCredit Risk Management\nOverview\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\nWe devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.\nGovernance\nOur credit risks are overseen and managed by ERM. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by highly experienced credit professionals that take and manage our credit risk. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives;\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\n• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies in all credit portfolios.\nWe monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data.\nSee Investments - Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.\nWe are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets businesses, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for properly identifying these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\nThe scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk-taking authorities, defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our Risk Appetite Statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, distinct from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.\nRisk Identification\nMarket risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial conditions, liquidity and capital.\nEach of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\nEquity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\nResidential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages: trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages (REITs), and residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nInterest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and resulting product changes will generally reduce the attractiveness of our insurance products in the marketplace. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric U.S. GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.\nCredit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the long-term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit-worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\nForeign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\nCommodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices.\nInflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\nGovernance\nMarket risk is managed at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM who work in partnership with the senior management of our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n• written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;\n• a limit framework that aligns with our Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement;\n• independent measurement, monitoring and reporting for line of business, business unit and enterprise-wide market risks; and\n• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to market risk management.\nThese components facilitate the CMRO’s identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and management of our market risks.\nRisk Measurement\nOur market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s Risk Appetite Statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nand liquidity levels under specific stress tests. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\nIn addition, we continue to enhance economic, U.S. GAAP accounting and statutory capital-based risk measures at the market risk level, business-unit level and firm-wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.\nWe use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:\nSensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input. Examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, a one basis point increase in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities, and a one percent increase in price on equity securities.\nScenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets. Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.\nStress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.\nMarket Risk Sensitivities\nThe following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:\nBalance Sheet Exposure\nBalance Sheet Effect\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions)\nSensitivity factor\n100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves\nInterest rate sensitive assets:\nFixed maturity securities\n273,885\n268,208\n(15,107)\n(14,341)\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n16,594\n14,649\n(921)\n(661)\nPreferred stock\n(1)\n(2)\nTotal interest rate sensitive assets\n$\n290,498\n(a)\n$\n282,878\n(a)\n$\n(16,029)\n(b)\n$\n(15,004)\nSensitivity factor\n20% decline in stock prices and value of\nalternative investments\nEquity and alternative investments exposure:\nHedge funds\n10,798\n9,900\n(2,160)\n(1,980)\nPrivate equity\n8,858\n9,810\n(1,772)\n(1,962)\nReal estate investments\n3,612\n3,113\n(722)\n(623)\nPICC(c)\n3,375\n2,536\n(675)\n(507)\nCommon equity\n2,044\n1,927\n(409)\n(385)\nAircraft asset investments\n(130)\n(153)\nAerCap\n4,972\n-\n(994)\n-\nOther investments\n1,331\n(266)\n(191)\nTotal equity and alternative investments\nexposure\n$\n35,641\n$\n29,006\n$\n(7,128)\n$\n(5,801)\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nSensitivity factor\n10% depreciation of all foreign currency\nexchange rates against the U.S. dollar\nForeign currency-denominated net\nasset position(d)\n$\n12,005\n$\n10,350\n$\n(1,201)\n$\n(1,035)\n(a) At December 31, 2014, the analysis covered $290 billion of $309 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded are $1 billion in DIB assets, $8 billion of loans, and $4 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2013, the analysis covered $283 billion of $306 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded are $6 billion in DIB assets, $5 billion of loans, and $4 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling and/or data limitations.\n(b) Commencing in the first quarter of 2014, we began using a duration and convexity method to estimate the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on each security. The change in method had no material effect on the amounts presented at December 31, 2013.\n(c) Includes our investments in PICC Group and PICC P&C.\n(d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\nForeign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non-U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. We manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency-denominated debt issued by AIG Parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk, including but not limited to the execution of cross-currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency-denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits. As a matter of general practice, we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries. However, we may utilize either cross-currency swaps or our foreign currency- denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries.\nAt December 31, 2014, our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in British pounds, Canadian dollars, Euro, Hong Kong dollars and Japanese yen. Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2014 increased by 16.0 percent, or $1.7 billion, compared to December 31, 2013. The increase was mostly due to a $650 million increase in our Hong Kong dollar position, primarily resulting from the Non-Life Insurance Companies investment in PICC P&C; a $585 million increase in our British pound position, primarily resulting from AIG Parent repurchasing outstanding British pound-denominated debt; a $378 million increase in our Japanese yen position, mainly attributable to Japanese yen deferred tax liability reduction; a $153 million increase in our Canadian dollar position, mainly attributable to an increase in operating income from underwriting and investments; and a $75 million increase in our Euro position primarily resulting from AIG Parent repurchasing outstanding Euro-denominated debt. These increases were partially offset by a $173 million decrease in our Polish zloty position, primarily resulting from the sale of our equity investment in Santander Consumer Bank.\nFor illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\nThe sensitivity factors utilized for 2014 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1994 to 2014, as follows (see the table below):\n• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;\n• a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and\n• a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Great Britain pound (GBP) exchange rate.\nScenario as\nas a Multiple\nOriginal 2013 Scenario (based\nStandard\nSuggested\na Multiple of\nChange/\nof Standard\non Standard Deviation for\nPeriod\nDeviation\nScenario\nStandard Deviation\nReturn\nDeviation\n1993-2013 Period)\n10-Year Treasury\n1994-2014\n0.01\n0.01\n1.00\n(0.01)\n0.87\n0.01\nS&P 500\n1994-2014\n0.19\n0.20\n1.05\n0.11\n0.60\n0.20\nUSD/GBP\n1994-2014\n0.09\n0.10\n1.07\n(0.06)\n0.63\n0.10\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nRisk Monitoring and Limits\nThe risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities must be reported to the ERM Market Risk team by the relevant business unit. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\nTo control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the CMRO closely monitors and reports to our CRO, senior management and risk committees.\nSee Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\nAIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash can be generated to meet the obligations as they come due.\nAIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period of up to one year. We maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach the tolerance, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\nRisk Identification\nThe following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.\n• Market/Monetization Risk: Assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.\n• Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n• Event Funding Risk: Additional funding is required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that created a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n• Financing Risk: We are unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\nGovernance\nLiquidity risk is managed at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The AIG CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer, with ERM oversight.\nThe Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement. The principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nlong-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.\nOur Liquidity Risk Management Framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.\nRisk Measurement\nComprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\nWe use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:\nCoverage Ratios: Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of a portfolio of assets to meet the forecasted net cash flow over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.\nAsset Ratios: Asset Ratios measure and track the quality of an entity’s assets that can be used to raise liquidity over a specified period of time.\nCash Flow Forecasts: Cash Flow Forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon.\nStress Testing: Coverage Ratios and Asset Ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.\nRelevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.\nOperational Risk Management\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes business and strategy risks.\nOperational risk is inherent in each of our business units and corporate functions. Operational risks can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies, operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.\nOur ORM function, which supports our ORC, has the responsibility to provide an aggregate view of our operational risk profile. Our ORM function oversees the Operational Risk policy and framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, monitoring and measurement. The ORM program captures various types of risk to provide an aggregate view for each business and function. This includes operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, access, data privacy and data security), third party providers, compliance and regulatory matters.\nEach business unit is responsible for managing its operational risks and implementing the components of the operational risk management program. In addition, certain corporate control functions have been assigned accountability for enterprise-wide operational risk management for their respective areas. These control functions include Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), Business Continuity Management (BCM), Information Technology Security Risk and Compliance, Model Validation and Vendor Risk\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nManagement. Senior business operational risk executives report to their respective business unit CRO and to the Head of our ORM. This reporting structure is designed to enable close alignment with the business unit while ensuring consistent implementation of operational risk management practices.\nA strong operational risk management program facilitates the identification and mitigation of operational risk issues. To accomplish this, our operational risk management program is designed to:\n• pro-actively address potential operational risk issues;\n• create transparency throughout the organization; and\n• assign clear ownership and accountability for addressing identified operational risk issues.\nAs part of the ORM framework, we deploy an integrated risk assessment approach which includes top-down risk assessments to identify our most significant operational risks, a Risk and Control Self Assessment (RCSA) process to identify key operational risks conducted at the business units and corporate functions and the identification of emerging risks through our Vulnerability Identification (VID) process which considers risks that have not yet fully manifested but could become significant over time. In addition, we conduct scenario analysis to identify remote but plausible potential risks that could result in severe financial losses. Corrective action plans are developed to address identified issues. Businesses are accountable for tracking and remediating these issues.\nOperational risk management reporting to senior management and operational risk governance committees provides awareness of operational risk exposures, identifies key risks and facilitates management decision making. Reporting includes operational risk mitigation and monitoring, RCSA results and the status of issue resolution to senior management.\nInsurance Operations Risks\nExcept as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\nOur insurance businesses are conducted on a global basis and expose us to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:\n• pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;\n• underwriting approval processes and authorities;\n• exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;\n• modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);\n• compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;\n• use of reinsurance, both internal and third-party; and\n• review and establishment of reserves.\nWe closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nRisk Identification\n• Non-Life Insurance Companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, management liability and mortgage insurance. We manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity. We manage risks in the mortgage insurance business through geographic classification, risk based pricing, premium adequacy monitoring, and prudent credit policy and underwriting standards.\n• Life Insurance Companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks, both for the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies.\nGovernance\nInsurance risks are managed at the business unit level within ERM through the business unit chief risk officers, who report directly to the AIG CRO. Oversight is provided by the business unit chief risk officers. The business unit chief risk officers and their teams work closely with management to manage insurance risks. The framework includes the following key components:\n• written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;\n• a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement; and\n• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.\nRisk Measurement, Monitoring and Limits\nWe use a number of approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure, including:\nStochastic methods. Stochastic methods are used to measure and monitor risks including natural catastrophe, reserve and premium risk. We develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.\nScenario analysis. Scenario or deterministic analysis is used to measure and monitor risks such as terrorism or to estimate losses due to man-made catastrophic scenarios.\nIn addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\nNon-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\nWe manage insurance risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nFor Non-Life Insurance Companies, insurance risks primarily include the following:\n• Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the Non-Life Insurance Companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. See Item 1. Business - A review of Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses herein for further information.\n• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the Non-Life Insurance Companies ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or expenses.\n• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers either due to an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event, or that actual reinsurance coverage is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\nNatural Catastrophe Risk\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts which allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\nOur natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\ndue to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\nThe estimates below are the Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.\nThe following table presents an overview of modeled losses (OEP) for top perils and countries.\nAt December 31, 2014\nNet of 2015\nNet of 2015\nPercent of Total\n(in millions)\nGross\nReinsurance\nReinsurance, After Tax\nShareholder Equity\nExposures:\nU.S. Hurricane (1-in-100)(a)\n$\n4,887\n$\n2,801\n$\n1,821\n1.7\n%\nU.S. Earthquake (1-in-250)(b)\n7,080\n3,522\n2,289\n2.1\nJapanese Wind (1-in-100)\n1,279\n1,225\n0.7\nJapanese Earthquake (1-in-250)(c)\n$\n1,159\n$\n$\n0.5\n%\n(a) The U.S. hurricane amount includes losses to Property from hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.\n(b) U.S. earthquake loss estimates represent exposure to Property, Workers’ Compensation (U.S.) and A&H business lines.\n(c) Japan Earthquake represents exposure to Property and A&H business lines.\nThe OEP estimates provided above reflect our in-force portfolios at September 30, 2014, for U.S. exposures, and at June 30, 2014 for Japan exposures. The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2015.\nAs noted above, AIG, along with other non-life insurance and reinsurance companies, utilizes industry-recognized catastrophe models and apply their proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\nAlso, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. However, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. In particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional reinsurance transactions. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\nOur 2015 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against a large U.S. loss, and a worldwide aggregate cover to protect against multiple, potentially smaller, losses. The attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $3 billion.\nActual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures for additional information.\nTerrorism Risk\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model and various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the Non-Life Insurance Companies exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\nOur largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2014. We also have smaller terrorism exposure in Canadian cities and in London.\nOur exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by TRIA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIA covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2015, TRIA covers 85 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is about $2.7 billion for 2014.\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks.\nMortgage Risk\nFor Mortgage Guaranty, the potential exposure to loss is due to borrower default on a first-lien residential mortgage; the primary drivers of this risk are changes in mortgage underwriting standards, home price depreciation, changes in the unemployment rate, changes in mortgage rates, and mortgagee behavior.\nMortgage Guaranty manages the quality of the loans it insures through use of a proprietary risk quality index. Mortgage Guaranty uses this index to determine an insurability threshold as well as to manage the risk distribution of its new business. Along with traditional mortgage underwriting variables, Mortgage Guaranty’s risk-based pricing model uses rating factors such as geography and the historical quality of a lender’s origination process to establish premium rates.\nReinsurance Recoverable\nAIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\nAt December 31, 2014, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $22.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.5 billion, ceded loss reserves of $15.7 billion including reserves for IBNR, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.0 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverables of $1.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2014 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ, perhaps materially, from the reserves currently ceded.\nThe Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and set limits with regard to the amount and type or exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity; and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or specified declines in risk-based capital (RBC) ratios. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nexposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2014, we held $7.4 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is our business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.\nThe following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\nAt December 31, 2014\nA.M.\nGross\nPercent of\nUncollateralized\nS&P\nBest\nReinsurance\nReinsurance\nCollateral\nReinsurance\n(in millions)\nRating(a)\nRating(a)\nAssets\nAssets(b)\nHeld(c)\nAssets\nReinsurer:\nSwiss Reinsurance Group of Companies\nAA-\nA+\n$\n2,366\n10.8\n%\n$\n$\n1,624\nBerkshire Hathaway Group of Companies\nAA+\nA++\n$\n1,920\n(d)\n8.7\n%\n$\n1,547\n$\nMunich Reinsurance Group of Companies\nAA-\nA+\n$\n1,867\n8.5\n%\n$\n$\n1,255\n(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of February 10, 2015.\n(b) Total reinsurance assets include both the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies reinsurance recoverable.\n(c) Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable balances.\n(d) Includes $1.5 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive reinsurance transaction pursuant to which a large portion of the Non-Life Insurance Companies net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO.

See Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Transfer of Domestic Asbestos Liabilities.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had no significant general reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels continued to increase in 2014, thereby increasing the industry’s underwriting capacity. This increased capacity has resulted in increased competition and lower rates for 2015 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\nSee Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets for further discussion of reinsurance recoverable.\nLife Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\nLife Insurance Companies manage these risks through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging. The emergence of significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period. For a further discussion of this risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\nFor Life Insurance Companies, insurance risks primarily include the following:\n• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher than expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n• Longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit arising from actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our retirement, institutional and annuity products.\n• Client behavioral risk including surrender/lapse risk - there are many assumptions made when products are sold including how long the contracts will persist. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nimpacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, tax law, regulations and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in the majority of our product lines.\n• Interest rate risk - represents the potential for loss due to a change in interest rates. Interest rate risk is measured with respect to assets, liabilities (both insurance-related and financial), and derivatives. This risk manifests itself when interest rates move significantly in a short period of time (interest rate shock) but can also manifest itself over a longer period of time such as a persistent low interest rate environment.\n• Equity risk - represents the potential for loss due to changes in equity prices. It affects equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities (and associated guaranteed living and death benefits), universal life insurance, and variable universal life insurance. It also affects our equity investments and equity-related investments. In addition, changes in the volatility of equity prices can affect the valuation of those insurance products that are accounted for in a manner similar to equity derivatives.\nOther Operations Risks\nGlobal Capital Markets\nGCM actively manages its exposures to limit potential economic losses, and in doing so, GCM must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for GCM’s operations. Our senior management has established various oversight committees to regularly monitor various financial market, operational and credit risks related to GCM’s operations. The senior management of GCM reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with AIG’s senior management.\nGCM Derivative Transactions\nA counterparty may default on any obligation to us, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. To help manage this risk, GCM operates within the guidelines set by the credit function within ERM. Transactions that fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the specific approval of ERM. It is also AIG’s policy to record credit valuation adjustments for potential counterparty default when necessary.\nIn addition, GCM utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding financial derivative transactions. GCM requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, GCM enters into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, GCM can set off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\nThe fair value of GCM’s interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward contracts reported in Derivative assets, at fair value, was approximately $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. Where applicable, these amounts have been determined in accordance with the respective master netting agreements.\nGCM evaluates counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the risk rating policies of ERM, and supplements such analysis with ratings from rating agencies, where applicable. In addition, GCM’s credit approval process involves pre-approved counterparty credit exposure limits that are established by ERM.\nItem 7 / enterprise risk management\nThe following table presents the fair value of GCM’s derivatives portfolios by internal counterparty credit rating:\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\nRating:\nAAA\n$\n$\nAA\nA\nBBB\nBelow investment grade\nTotal\n$\n1,431\n$\n1,377\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion related to derivative transactions.\nAIG Parent and Other\nThe major risk for investments in life settlements is longevity risk, which represents the risk of a change in the carrying value of the contracts arising from actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from longer term societal health changes as well as other factors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.\nThe accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:\n• classification of ILFC as held for sale and related fair value measurement;\n• income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;\n• liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses;\n• reinsurance assets;\n• valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition;\n• valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products;\n• estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products;\n• impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on investments in life settlements and goodwill impairment;\n• liability for legal contingencies; and\n• fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.\nThese accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nThe major assumptions used to establish each critical accounting estimate are discussed below.\nClassification of ILFC as Held for Sale and Related Fair Value Measurement\nWe report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the next 12 months, which may require significant judgment, and certain other specified criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized.\nOn December 16, 2013, AIG Parent and Seller entered into a definitive agreement with AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap) and AerCap Ireland Limited for the sale of 100 percent of the common stock of ILFC (the AerCap Agreement) for consideration consisting of $3.0 billion of cash and approximately 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares. The consideration had a value of approximately $5.4 billion based on AerCap’s pre-announcement closing price per share of $24.93 on December 13, 2013. Upon closing of the transaction on May 14, 2014, we recorded the 97.6 million AerCap shares received at their then fair value of $47.01 and, together with the next cash received, recorded pre-tax and after-tax gains of approximately $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2014. We determined ILFC met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting at December 31, 2013. Because we received approximately 46 percent of the common stock of AerCap upon closing of the transaction and we continued to hold such percentage at December 31, 2014, ILFC does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Consequently, ILFC’s operating results are presented in continuing operations for all periods presented.\nIncome Taxes\nRecoverability of Net Deferred Tax Asset\nThe evaluation of the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\nWe consider a number of factors to reliably estimate future taxable income, so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses (NOLs), foreign tax credits (FTCs), capital loss and other carryforwards. These factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and AIG-specific conditions and events. We subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. We also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our income forecasts, coupled with our tax planning strategies, all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the U.S. tax attributes prior to their expiration.\nSee Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our framework for assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax asset.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nOur accounting for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions, represents management’s best estimate of various events and transactions, and requires judgment. FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48) (now incorporated into Accounting Standards Codification, 740, Income Taxes) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and additional disclosures. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nmerits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.\nWe classify interest expense and penalties recognized on income taxes as a component of income taxes.\nU.S. Income Taxes on Earnings of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to determining the amount of income taxes related to differences between the book carrying amounts and tax bases of subsidiaries are complex. Determining the amount also requires significant judgment and reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates.\nInsurance Liabilities\nLiability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (Non-Life Insurance Companies)\nThe estimate of the Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consists of several key judgments:\n• the determination of the actuarial models used as the basis for these estimates;\n• the relative weights given to these models by class;\n• the underlying assumptions used in these models; and\n• the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar classes and, in some cases, the segmentation of dissimilar claims within a class.\nWe use numerous assumptions in determining the best estimate of reserves for each class of business. The importance of any specific assumption can vary by both class of business and accident year. Because actual experience can differ from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves. This is particularly true for long-tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty, asbestos, D&O, and primary or excess workers’ compensation.\nAll of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. Reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.\nIn some of our estimation processes we rely on the claims department estimates of our case reserves as an input to our best estimate of the ultimate loss cost.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nOverview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\nThe Non-Life Insurance Companies’ loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail classes of business consist principally of property, Personal Insurance and certain casualty classes. Long-tail casualty classes of business include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers’ compensation, general liability, products liability and related classes.\nShort-Tail Reserves\nFor operations writing short-tail coverages, such as property, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is generally geared toward maintaining incurred but not reported reserves based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than determining an ultimate loss ratio for current business based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the most recent quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be maintained regardless of the actual losses emerging in the current quarter. The percent of premium factor would reflect both the expected ultimate cost for reported claims and the expected percentage of losses that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss ratio from a period of preceding years that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. The expected percentage of losses that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined using alternative techniques in close collaboration with the claims department. For some classes, a loss development factor method or percentage of monthly losses method may be used to determine IBNR reserves.\nLong-Tail Reserves\nEstimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for long-tail casualty classes of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the class and volume of business, as well as estimates of the reinsurance recoverable. Experience in the more recent accident years shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses on long-tail casualty classes of business. That is because a relatively low proportion of net incurred losses represent reported claims and expenses, and an even smaller percentage represents net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR constitutes a relatively high proportion of net losses.\nTo estimate net losses for long-tail casualty classes\nof business, we\nuse a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions.\nTo estimate net losses for long-tail casualty classes of business, we use a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions and other analytical techniques as described below. A detailed reserve review is generally performed at least once per year to allow for comprehensive actuarial evaluation and collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nWe generally make a number of actuarial assumptions in the review of reserves for each class of business.\nFor longer-tail classes of business, we generally make actuarial assumptions with respect to the following:\n• Loss cost trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.\n• Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2014 for the year-end 2014 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low-frequency, high-severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.\n• Loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.\nWe record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of the Non-Life Insurance Companies classes of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all classes of business. For most long-tail classes of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest reserve studies or large loss analysis, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter.\nDetails of the Loss Reserving Process\nThe process of determining the current loss ratio for each class of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility, corporate bond spreads, or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each class of business is intended to represent our best estimate of the current loss ratio after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business is changed to reflect the revised assumptions.\nWe conduct a comprehensive loss reserve review at least annually for each of the Non-Life Insurance Company and class of business. The reserve analysis for each class of business is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In this process, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial methods for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the segmentation of data that will enable the most suitable test of reserve adequacy. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews an actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these central estimates for each class of business provides an overall actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve for that class.\nWe continue to consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments. In 2014, the third party actuarial reviews covered the majority of net reserves held for our Commercial long-tail classes of business, and run-off portfolios reported in Corporate and Other.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nIn determining the actual carried reserves, we consider both the internal actuarial best estimate and numerous other internal and external factors, including:\n• an assessment of economic conditions including real GDP growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility and changes in corporate bond spreads;\n• changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment including changes in road safety, public health and cleanup standards;\n• changes in medical cost trends (inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services) and wage inflation trends\n• underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions including attachment points and policy limits;\n• claims handling processes and enhancements;\n• third-party claims reviews that are periodically performed for key classes of claims such as toxic tort, environmental and other complex casualty claims and\n• third-party actuarial reviews that are periodically performed for key classes of business.\nLoss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements.\nActuarial and Other Methods for Major Classes of Business\nIn testing the reserves for each class of business, our actuaries determine the most appropriate actuarial methods. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the claims associated with the class of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. Other considerations include the loss development characteristics associated with the claims, the volume of claim data available for the applicable class, and the applicability of various actuarial methods to the class. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. For example, we write many unique subclasses of professional liability. For pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subclass individually. However, for purposes of estimating the loss reserves for many classes of business, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subclasses into larger groups to produce a greater degree of credibility in the claims experience. This determination of data segmentation and actuarial methods is carefully considered for each class of business. The segmentation and actuarial methods chosen are those which together are expected to produce the most robust estimate of the loss reserves.\nThe actuarial methods we use for most long-tail casualty classes of business include loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods described below, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for subsequent accident years. Loss development methods generally are most appropriate for classes of business which exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the classes have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as excess casualty exposures. In 2014, we continued to refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty classes of business and adopted further segmentations based on our analysis of the differing emerging loss patterns for certain classes of insureds. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacks sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new classes of business or for long-tail classes at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\nExpected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the class of business to determine the loss reserves. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a class of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this class. Under the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail class of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be applied to the 90 percent of the losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nof the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the class of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\nA key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the class of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to the expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is not credible. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it will continue at later stages of development. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as “Bornhuetter Ferguson” have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\nFrequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the class of business must consist of homogeneous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity classes of business such as personal auto.\nStructural drivers analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural drivers analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation class of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future propensity for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n• Claim by claim reviews to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits - the claim file review was facilitated by third party specialists experienced in workers’ compensation claims;\n• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for AIG’s primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and AIG’s opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the class of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n• The effects of various run-off claims management strategies that have been developed by AIG’s run-off unit.\nDuring 2014, we continued to expand our analysis of structural drivers as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we considered the impact of changes in economic activity (real GDP growth) on our emerging experience in the Commercial Auto Liability class of business, particularly business written in excess of a large insured deductible where ground up experience may take several years to pierce our layer. Further, we considered the impact of expected levels of future inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Deflator (Health Services Component) published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis on our ultimate loss costs for medical benefits in the primary workers’ compensation class of business. We believe the PCE Deflator provides a more appropriate measure of workers’ compensation medical inflation as it includes medical expenditures made by employers on behalf of their employees. We also tested the sensitivity of our estimates to changes in the future path and level of inflation for this class of business.\nOverall, our loss reserve reviews for long-tail classes typically utilize a combination of both loss development and expected loss ratio methods, supplemented by structural drivers analysis of frequency/severity where available. Loss development methods are generally given more weight for accident years and classes of business where the loss experience is highly credible. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight where the reported loss experience is less credible, or is driven more by large losses. Expected loss ratio methods require sufficient information to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio. This information generally includes the actual loss ratios for prior accident years, and rate changes as well as underwriting or other changes which would affect the loss ratio. Further, an estimate of the loss cost trend or loss ratio trend is required to allow for the effect of inflation and other factors which may increase or otherwise change the loss costs from one accident year to the next.\nThe estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\nWe continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current Non-Life Insurance Companies Environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\nThe majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\nReserve Estimation for Asbestos and Environmental Claims\nEstimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process. Reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. The methods used to determine asbestos and environmental loss estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management.\nVarious factors contribute to the complexity and difficulty in determining the future development of claims. Significant factors that influence the claims estimation process include court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\ninvolve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government’s refusal to release parties from liability. Future claims development also will be affected by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage and liability issues.\nIf the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, resulting deficiencies could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations for an individual reporting period.\nWith respect to known environmental claims, we established over two decades ago a specialized environmental claims unit, which investigates and adjusts all such environmental claims. This unit evaluates environmental claims utilizing a claim-by-claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, we generally evaluate exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques must be supplemented by subjective considerations, including management judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi-annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information.\nThe environmental claims unit also actively manages and pursues early resolution with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. We attempt to mitigate our known long-tail environmental exposures through a combination of proactive claim-resolution techniques, including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, when appropriate, litigation.\nKnown asbestos claims are managed in a similar manner. Over two decades ago we established a specialized toxic tort claims unit, which historically investigated and adjusted all such asbestos claims. As part of the above mentioned NICO transaction, effective January 1, 2011, NICO assumed responsibility for claims handling related to the majority of AIG’s domestic asbestos liabilities.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nThe following is a discussion of actuarial methods applied by major class of business:\nClass of Business or Category and Actuarial Method\nApplication of Actuarial Method\nExcess Casualty\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess casualty classes.\nFrequency/severity methods are generally not used in isolation to determine ultimate loss costs as the vast majority of reported claims do not result in claim payment. (However, frequency/severity methods assist in the regular monitoring of the adequacy of carried reserves to support incurred but not reported claims). In addition, the average severity varies significantly from accident year to accident year due to large losses which characterize this class of business, as well as changing proportions of claims which do not result in a claim payment. To gain more stability in the projection, the claims amenable to loss development methods are analyzed in multiple layers: the layer capped at $1 million, $4 million excess of $1 million, $5 million excess of $5 million, $15 million excess of $10 million, and the layer above $25 million. The expected loss ratios for the layers above $1 million are derived from the expected relationship between the layers, reflecting the attachment point and limit by accident year.\nIn addition, we leverage case reserving based methodologies for complex claims/ latent exposures such as those involving toxic tort and other claims accumulations.\nExpected loss ratio methods are generally used for at least the three latest accident years, due to the relatively low credibility of the reported losses. The loss experience is generally reviewed separately for lead umbrella classes and for other excess classes, due to the relatively shorter tail for lead umbrella business. Automobile-related claims are generally reviewed separately from non-auto claims, due to the shorter-tail nature of the automobile-related claims. Claims relating to certain latent exposures such as construction defects, exhaustion of underlying product aggregate limits, or mass torts are reviewed separately due to the unique emergence patterns of losses relating to these claims. The expected loss ratios used for recent accident years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios of prior years, adjusted for rate changes, estimated loss cost trends and all other changes that can be quantified.\nDuring 2014, we estimated the loss development patterns for mass tort claims separately from non-mass tort claims based on our experience over the last 30 years. This segmentation led to lower estimates for accident years 2005 and subsequent for non-mass tort claims where we expect underwriting actions and reductions in policy limits to have a favorable effect on ultimate losses, particularly for accident years 2007 to 2013. This was entirely offset by higher selected ultimates for accident years 2004 and prior as a result of this segmentation.\nD&O and Related Management Liability Classes of Business\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for D&O and related management liability classes of business.\nFrequency/severity methods are generally not used in isolation for these classes as the overall losses are driven by large losses more than by claim frequency. Severity trends have varied significantly from accident year to accident year and care is required in analyzing these trends by claim type. We also give weight to claim department ground-up projections of ultimate loss on a claim by claim basis as these may be more predictive of ultimate loss values especially for older accident years.\nThese classes of business reflect claims made coverage, and losses are characterized by low frequency and high severity. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight in the two most recent accident years, whereas loss development methods are given more weight in more mature accident years. For the year-end 2014 loss reserve review, claims projections for accident years 2013 and prior were used.\nWorkers’ Compensation\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for workers’ compensation. We segment the data by state and industry class to the extent that meaningful differences are determined to exist.\nFor guaranteed cost business, expected loss ratio methods generally are given significant weight only in the most recent accident year. Workers’ compensation claims are generally characterized by high frequency, low severity, and relatively consistent loss development from one accident year to the next. We historically have been a leading writer of workers’ compensation, and thus have sufficient volume of claims experience to use development methods. We generally segregate California (CA) business from other business in evaluating workers’ compensation reserves. In 2012, we segmented out New York (NY) from the other states to reflect its different development pattern and changing percentage of the mix by state. We also revised our assumptions to reflect changes in our claims management activities. Certain classes of workers’ compensation, such as construction and business written in excess of a deductible, are also evaluated separately. Expected loss ratio methods for business written in excess of a deductible may be given significant weight in the five or more most recent accident years. Additionally, we write a number of very large accounts which include workers’ compensation coverage. These accounts are generally individually priced by our actuaries, and to the extent appropriate, the indicated losses based on the pricing analysis may be used to record the initial estimated loss reserves for these accounts.\nIn 2014, we refined the segmentation of business written in excess of a deductible by analyzing loss development separately for each layer/deductible size group. We also updated our tail factor selections in CA and NY and our loss development factors in the Construction class. Each of these segments appears to have been impacted by specific structural changes in the portfolio. For CA business, our tail factor increases were in response to changing long-term medical development patterns. In NY, there has been a lengthening of the period between the date of accident and the classification of non-scheduled permanent partial injuries. We completed a review of claim emergence and payouts for our top six states in workers’ compensation and concluded that NY and CA were the main states where the loss development patterns had materially changed since our last review. For excess of large deductible business, we updated our analyses to consider the impact of changes in the mix of retentions that has occurred over time as the data by retention band was becoming more credible. Lastly, for the Construction class, we noted that the construction sector has experienced a comparatively slow recovery in payroll levels. As a result of the diminished employment opportunities in this industry sector, injured workers may experience limited return-to-work opportunities, which moderate the shortening of claim duration that normally accompanies a labor market recovery.\nIn 2014, we also enhanced our analysis by considering our best estimate expectations of inflation (principally, the PCE Deflator for Health Care Services) and loss cost trends and we also reflected the impacts of enhancements in our claim management and loss mitigation activities, such as opioid drug management, fraud investigation and medical management.\nExcess Workers’ Compensation\nWe historically have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers’ compensation. For the year-end 2014 loss reserve review, our actuaries supplemented the methods used historically by applying a structural drivers approach to inform their judgment of the ultimate loss costs for open reported claims from accident years 2006 and prior and used the refined analysis to help inform their judgment of the ultimate loss cost for claims that have not yet been reported using a frequency/severity approach for these accident years.\nExcess workers’ compensation is an extremely long-tail class of business, with loss emergence extending for decades. The class is highly sensitive to small changes in assumptions - in the rate of medical inflation or the longevity of injured workers, for example - which can have a significant effect on the ultimate reserve estimate. Claims estimates for this line also are highly sensitive to:\n· the assumed future rate of inflation and other economic conditions in the United States;\n· changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment;\n· the expected impact of recently enacted health care reform on workers’ compensation costs;\n· underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions;\n· claims settlement trends that can materially alter the mix and ultimate cost of claims;\n· changes in claims reporting and management practices of insureds and their third-party administrators;\n· the cost of new and additional treatment specialties, such as “pain management”;\n· the propensity for severely injured workers’ medical conditions to deteriorate in the future;\n· changes in injured worker longevity; and\n· territorial experience differences (across states and within regions in a state).\nMethods based on expected loss ratios are given the greater weight for the more recent accident years. For the year-end 2014 loss reserve review, the structural drivers approach which was applied to open reported claims from accident years 2006 and prior, was deemed to be most suitable for informing our judgment of the ultimate loss cost for injured workers whose medical conditions had largely stabilized (i.e., at least 9 to 10 years have elapsed since the date of injury). The reserve for accident years 2007 and subsequent was determined using a Generalized Cape Cod Method, which is similar to a Bornhuetter Ferguson expected loss ratio method.\nGeneral Liability\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for primary general liability or products liability classes. We also supplement the standard actuarial techniques by using evaluations of the ultimate losses on unusual claims or claim accumulations by external specialists on those classes of claims. The segmentation of the data reflects state differences, industry classes, deductible/non-deductible programs and type of claim.\nFor certain classes of business with sufficient loss volume, loss development methods may be given significant weight for all but the most recent one or two accident years. For smaller or more volatile classes of business, loss development methods may be given limited weight for the five or more most recent accident years. Expected loss ratio methods are used for the more recent accident years for these classes. The loss experience for primary general liability business is generally reviewed at a level that is believed to provide the most appropriate data for reserve analysis. Additionally, certain sub-classes, such as construction, are generally reviewed separately from business in other subclasses. For other sub-classes, such as Environmental, we utilize the claim analysts’ claim projections for incurred but not enough reported (IBNER) and actuarial methods to calculate pure IBNR. In 2014, we continued to refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty classes of business and adopted further segmentations based on our analysis of the differing emerging loss patterns for certain classes of insureds. Due to the fairly long-tail nature of general liability business, and the many subclasses that are reviewed individually, there is less credibility given to the reported losses and increased reliance on expected loss ratio methods for recent accident years.\nCommercial Automobile Liability\nWe generally use loss development methods for all but the most recent accident year for commercial automobile liability classes of business.\nExpected loss ratio methods are generally given significant weight only in the most recent accident year.\nIn 2014, we considered the impact of changes in economic activity (real GDP growth) on our emerging experience in the Commercial Auto Liability class of business, particularly business written in excess of a large insured deductible where ground up experience may take several years to pierce our layer.\nHealthcare\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for healthcare classes of business.\nFrequency/severity methods are sometimes used for pricing certain healthcare accounts or business. However, for loss reserve adequacy testing, the need to ensure sufficient credibility generally results in segmentations that are not sufficiently homogenous to utilize frequency/severity methods.\nWe also supplement the standard actuarial techniques by using evaluations of the ultimate losses on unusual claims by specialists on those classes of claims.\nThe largest component of the healthcare business consists of coverage written for hospitals and other healthcare facilities. We test reserves for excess coverage separately from those for primary coverage. For primary coverages, loss development methods are generally given the majority of the weight for all but the latest three accident years, and are given some weight for all years other than the latest accident year. For excess coverages, expected loss methods are generally given all the weight for the latest three accident years, and are also given considerable weight for accident years prior to the latest three years. For other classes of healthcare coverage, an analogous weighting between loss development and expected loss ratio methods is used. The weights assigned to each method are those that are believed to result in the best combination of responsiveness and credibility.\nProfessional Liability\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for professional liability classes of business.\nFrequency/severity methods are used in pricing and profitability analyses for some classes of professional liability; however, for loss reserve adequacy testing, the need to ensure sufficient credibility generally results in segmentations that are not sufficiently homogenous to utilize frequency/severity methods.\nWe also use claim department projections of the ultimate value of each reported claim to supplement and inform the standard actuarial approaches.\nLoss development methods are used for the more mature accident years. Greater weight is given to expected loss ratio methods in the more recent accident years. Reserves are tested separately for claims made classes and classes written on occurrence policy forms. Further segmentations are made in a manner believed to provide an appropriate balance between credibility and homogeneity of the data.\nCatastrophic Casualty\nWe use expected loss ratio methods for all accident years for catastrophic casualty business. This class of business consists of casualty or financial lines coverage that attach in excess of very high attachment points; thus the claims experience is marked by very low frequency and high severity. Because of the limited number of claims, loss development methods are not relied upon.\nThe expected loss ratios and loss development assumptions used are based upon the results of prior accident years for this business as well as for similar classes of business written above lower attachment points. The business can be written on a claims-made or occurrence basis. We use ground-up claim projections provided by our claims staff to assist in developing the appropriate reserve.\nAviation\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for aviation exposures. Aviation claims are not very long-tail in nature; however, they are driven by claim severity. Thus a combination of both development and expected loss ratio methods are used for all but the latest accident year to determine the loss reserves.\nFrequency/severity methods are not employed due to the high severity nature of the claims and different mix of claims from year to year.\nExpected loss ratio methods are used to determine the loss reserves for the latest accident year. We also use ground-up claim projections provided by our claims staff to assist in developing the appropriate reserve.\nPersonal Auto\nWe generally use frequency/severity methods and loss development methods for domestic personal auto classes.\nFor many classes of business, greater reliance is placed on frequency/severity methods as claim counts emerge quickly for personal auto and allow for more immediate analysis of resulting loss trends and comparisons to industry and other diagnostic metrics.\nFidelity/Surety\nWe generally use loss development methods for fidelity exposures for all but the latest accident year. For surety exposures, we generally use the same method as for short-tail classes (discussed below).\nExpected loss ratio methods are also given weight for the more recent accident years. For the latest accident year they may be given 100 percent weight.\nMortgage Guaranty\nWe test mortgage guaranty reserves using loss development methods, supplemented by an internal claim analysis by actuaries and staff who specialize in the mortgage guaranty business.\nThe reserve analysis projects ultimate losses for claims within each of several reserving categories based on actual historical experience, using primarily a frequency/severity loss development approach. Additional reserve tests are also employed, such as tests measuring losses as a percent of risk in force. Reserves are reviewed separately for each line of business considering the loss development characteristics, volume of claim data available and applicability of various actuarial methods to each line.\nReserves for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses are established for reported mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, based upon historical reporting trends. We establish reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability (for each delinquent loan reported) that is based upon projected claim experience for each category of delinquency, consistent in total with the overall reserve estimate.\nMortgage Guaranty losses and loss adjustment expenses have been affected by macroeconomic events, such as improving home prices and decreasing unemployment. Because these macroeconomic events are subject to adverse or favorable change, the determination of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses requires a high degree of judgment. Improving economic conditions have produced higher cure rates of delinquent loans in 2014, particularly in the most recent accident periods that may not continue in 2015. In addition, loans with modifications through government and lender programs may re-default resulting in new losses for Mortgage Guaranty if adverse economic conditions were to return. In addition to improved cure rates, the favorable economic trends have resulted in a decline of newly reported delinquencies. Partially offsetting these favorable frequency trends were increases in severity, particularly for older delinquencies with larger delinquent interest costs, and a lower incidence of denied and rescinded claims.\nOther Short-Tail Classes\nFor non catastrophe business, we generally use either loss development methods or IBNR factor methods to set reserves for short-tail classes such as property coverages.\nFor natural catastrophe’s, collaboration with the claims department and profit center management is done to determine the ultimate losses.\nWhere factors are used, they generally represent the percent of expected losses or other exposure measure yet to be reported. The factors are determined based on prior accident quarter loss emergence. The factors are continually reevaluated in light of emerging claim experience as well as rate changes or other factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed.\nInternational\nBusiness written by the Non-Life Insurance Companies internationally includes both long-tail and short-tail classes of business. For long-tail classes of business, the actuarial methods used are comparable to those described above. However, the majority of business written by the Non-Life Insurance Companies internationally is short-tail, high frequency and low severity in nature. For this business, loss development methods are generally employed to test the loss reserves.\nWe maintain a database of detailed historical premium and loss transactions in original currency for business written by the Non-Life Insurance Companies internationally. This allows our actuaries to determine the current reserves without any distortion from changes in exchange rates over time. Our actuaries segment the international data by region, country or class of business as appropriate to determine an optimal balance between homogeneity and credibility. The techniques developed by our U.S. actuaries for certain commercial classes of business are increasingly applied to our International portfolios where the experience volume and data segmentation is comparable to that of the U.S. portfolios. Our actuaries work closely with the claims departments in each of our major International locations to determine the most appropriate methodology and assumptions.\nLoss Adjustment Expenses\nWe determine reserves for legal defense and cost containment loss adjustment expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. The methods generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. The development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar classes of business.\nWe generally determine reserves for adjuster loss adjustment expenses based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular class of business. We generally determine reserves for other unallocated loss adjustment expenses based on the ratio of the calendar year expenses paid to overall losses paid. This determination is generally done for all classes of business combined, and reflects costs of home office claim overhead as a percent of losses paid. We may supplement our judgments with an analysis of loss and legal expense mix change using predictive models that explicitly represent such mix change and detailed reviews with the claims department on the methods used to allocate the costs of the claims initiatives to new and in-force business and to different classes and sub-classes of business.\nCatastrophes and Severe Losses\nWe conduct special analyses in response to major catastrophes and severe losses to estimate our gross and net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from those events.\nThese analyses may include a combination of approaches, including modeling estimates, ground-up claim analysis, loss evaluation reports from on-site field adjusters, and market share estimates.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nAlternative Loss Cost Trend and Loss Development Factor Assumptions by Class of Business\nFor classes of business other than the classes discussed below, there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor assumptions.\nThe effect of these deviations is expected to be smaller than the effect on the classes noted below:\nLoss cost trends: The percentage deviations noted in the table below are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what we consider to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. The impacts cited\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nbelow are only for the years using an expected loss ratio approach. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for several years whereas actual loss cost trends exceeded the figures cited below for 1997 through 2001. Loss trends may deviate by more than the amounts noted above and discussed below.\nLoss development factors: The percentage deviations noted in the table below are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what we consider to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. While multiple scenarios are performed, the assumed loss development factors are a key assumption. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. Future loss development patterns may be different from those in the past, or may deviate by more than the amounts noted above and discussed below.\nAIG’s loss reserve analyses do not generally provide a range of loss reserve estimates. A large portion of the loss reserves from the Non-Life Insurance Companies business relates to longer-tail casualty classes of business, such as excess casualty and D&O, which are driven by severity rather than frequency of claims. Using the reserving methodologies described above, our actuaries determine their actuarial central estimates of the loss reserves and advise management on their final recommendation for management’s best estimate of the recorded reserves. Subject matter experts from underwriting and claims play an important part in informing the actuarial assumptions and methods. The governance process over the establishment of loss reserves also ensures robust considerations of the changes in the loss trends, terms and conditions, claims handling practices, and large loss impact when determining the methods, assumptions and the estimations. This multi-disciplinary process engages underwriting, claims, risk management, business unit executives and senior management and involves several iterative levels of feedback and response during the regular reserving process.\nThe sensitivity analysis below addresses each major class of business for which there is a possibility of a material deviation from our overall reserve position. The analysis uses what we believe is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation for each class. Actual reserve development may not be consistent with either the original or the adjusted loss trend or loss development factor assumptions, and other assumptions made in the reserving process may materially affect reserve development for a particular class of business.\nClass of Business\nLoss Cost Trend\nLoss Development Factor\nExcess Casualty\nThe assumed loss cost trend was approximately five percent in the 2014 reserve review. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2014 loss reserve review for excess casualty will range from 0 percent to positive ten percent. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the excess casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the claims and therefore is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting claims.\nAfter evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range from approximately 2 percent below those actually utilized in the year-end 2014 reserve review to approximately 3 percent above those factors actually utilized. Excess casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting claims.\nD&O and Related Management Liability Classes of Business\nThe assumed loss cost trend was approximately 2 percent. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of recent claims relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2014 loss reserve review for these classes will range from approximately 29 percent lower or 27 percent higher than the assumption actually utilized in the year-end 2014 reserve review. Because the D&O class of business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation.\nThe assumed loss development factors are also an important assumption but less critical than for excess casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for excess casualty. However, the high severity nature of the claims does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. After evaluating the historical loss development factors for these classes of business for accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range from approximately 6 percent lower to approximately 16 percent higher than those factors actually indicated in the year-end 2014 loss reserve review for these classes.\nPrimary Workers’ Compensation\nThe loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our loss reserves. This is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers’ compensation business.\nGenerally, our actual historical workers’ compensation loss development factors would be expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future loss development. However, workers’ compensation is a long-tail class of business, and our business reflects a very significant volume of losses, particularly in recent accident years. After evaluating the actual historical loss development since the 1980s for this business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss reserves will fall within the range of approximately 9 percent below to approximately 11 percent above those actually indicated in the year-end 2014 loss reserve review.\nBased on our sensitivity testing, we also estimate that a 1 percent rise in the future rate of inflation (PCE Deflator for Health Care Services increased by 1 percent at the 30-year time horizon, with increases in the forward rate of inflation assumed to occur proportionally over time (i.e. the zero-year/1-year forward inflation rate would change by 1/30th of 1 percentage point)) would increase our ultimate loss cost estimates by approximately $210 million as of December 31, 2014.\nIn 2014, however, we corroborated our judgments using traditional loss development projections with three-dimensional loss development models incorporating accident year, development year and calendar year trends. This allowed us to consider for example, the effect of changing levels of inflation (specifically the PCE Deflator for Health Care Services) on our ultimate loss costs for medical benefits. These methodologies also facilitate a more quantitative assessment of the uncertainty in our estimates reflecting structural drivers of loss along each dimension.\nExcess Workers’ Compensation (run-off only)\nLoss costs were trended at six percent per annum. After reviewing actual industry loss trends for the past ten years, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2014 loss reserve review for excess workers’ compensation will range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. However, given the small volume of business written in these years, the range in reserve estimates as a result of varying these loss cost trends is not very wide.\nExcess workers’ compensation is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. After evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up claim projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development for excess workers’ compensation could increase the current reserves by up to approximately $1.0 billion or decrease them by approximately $250 million.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nThe following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2014.\nDecember 31, 2014\nEffect on\nEffect on\n(in millions)\nLoss Reserves\nLoss Reserves\nLoss cost trends:\nLoss development factors:\nExcess casualty:\nExcess casualty:\n5 percent increase\n$\n1,200\n6 percent increase\n$\n5 percent decrease\n(800)\n3 percent decrease\n(650)\nD&O:\nD&O:\n27 percent increase\n1,240\n16 percent increase\n29 percent decrease\n(925)\n6 percent decrease\n(360)\nExcess workers' compensation:\nExcess workers' compensation:\n5 percent increase\nN/A\nIncrease(b)\n1,000\n5 percent decrease\nN/A\nDecrease (b)\n(250)\nPrimary workers' compensation(a):\nPrimary workers' compensation:\n11 percent increase(c)\n1,400\n9 percent decrease(c)\n(1,100)\n(a) Loss cost trend assumption does not have a material impact for this line of business.\n(b) Percentages not applicable due to extremely long-tailed nature of workers’ compensation.\n(c) Impact was determined based on analysis of aggregate variability of loss development assumptions.\nReinsurance Assets\nThe estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. Reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves.\nWe assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets in the balance sheet. This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n• paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n• whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n• whether the reinsurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction); and\n• whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\nAt December 31, 2014, the allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance was $258 million.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on reinsurance.\nFuture Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts (Life Insurance Companies)\nLong-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nFor long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\nLoss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If a loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loss recognition. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\nGroupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring and servicing the business and applied by product groupings. We perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities, and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition tests include the following:\n• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically segregate assets that match liabilities and then project future cash flows on those assets. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends, advice from industry public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products relative to expected rates on competing products under different interest scenarios.\n• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\nThe Life operating segment recorded loss recognition expense of $87 million in 2014 and $67 million in 2012 to increase reserves for certain discontinued long-term care business as a result of updated assumptions. Sales of investment securities in connection with our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards and other investment sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered recording of loss recognition expense of $30 million, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily related to certain long-term payout annuity contracts in the Institutional Markets and Retirement operating segments. See Results of Operations - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Loss Recognition for additional discussion.\nSignificant unrealized appreciation on investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (“shadow loss recognition”). These charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\ninvestments. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on shadow loss recognition. In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\nGuaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products (Life Insurance Companies)\nVariable annuity products offered by our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these features. For GMDB, our most widely offered guaranteed benefit feature, the liabilities included in Future policyholder benefits at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $401 million and $355 million, respectively. The fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivatives included in Policyholder contract deposits was a net liability of $957 million at December 31, 2014 and a net asset of $37 million at December 31, 2013.\nThe liabilities for GMDB and GMIB, which are recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments, through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred. The liabilities for GMWB and GMAV, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses).\nOur exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are mutually exclusive, so the exposure to the guaranteed amount for each feature is not additive to that of other features. A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits. See Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance) below for sensitivity analysis which includes the sensitivity of reserves for guaranteed benefit features to changes in the assumptions for equity market returns, volatility and mortality. For a further discussion of the risks related to guaranteed benefit features of variable annuities, our dynamic hedging program and risks of AIG’s unhedged exposures, see Item 1A. - Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\nThe reserving methodology and assumptions used to measure the liabilities of our two largest guaranteed benefit features are presented in the following table:\nReserving Methodology\nAssumptions and Accounting Judgments\nGMDB\nWe determine the GMDB liability at each balance sheet date by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected fees. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on how we reserve for variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features.\nKey assumptions include :\n• Interest rates, which vary by year of issuance and products\n• Mortality rates, which are based upon actual experience modified to allow for variations in policy form\n• Lapse rates, which are based upon actual experience modified to allow for variations in policy form\n• Investment returns, using assumptions from a randomly generated model\n• In applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of the GMDB liability, we use a “reversion to the mean” methodology, similar to that applied for DAC. For a description of this methodology, see Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies) below.\nGMWB\nGMWB living benefits are embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value. The fair value estimates of the living benefit guarantees include assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates, market volatility, and policyholder behavior. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on how we reserve for variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on fair value measurement of these embedded derivatives, including how AIG incorporates its own non-performance risk.\nThe fair value of the embedded derivatives is based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. Key assumptions include:\n• Equity market returns\n• Interest rates\n• Market volatility\n• Benefits and related fees assessed, when applicable\n• Policyholder behavior, including mortality, exercise of guarantees and policy lapses. Estimates of future policyholder behavior are subjective and based primarily on our historical experience\n• In applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of GMWBs, we use market-consistent assumptions consistent with fair value measurement\n• Allocation of fees between the embedded derivative and host contract\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nEstimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies)\nPolicy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\nIf the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and URR, are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\nIn estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 8.5% (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) is applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a “reversion to the mean” methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nbelow the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, we revised the growth rate assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period for the Group Retirement product line, because annual growth assumptions indicated for that period had fallen below our floor of zero percent due to the favorable performance of equity markets. For this five-year reversion to the mean period, the growth rate assumption was adjusted to a point between the long-term growth rate assumption and zero percent. This adjustment increased Retirement pre-tax operating income by $35 million in 2013. Had we readjusted the growth rate assumption for the five-year reversion to the mean period to use the long-term rate assumption of 8.5%, pre-tax income would have been higher by approximately $30 million. Conversely, had the growth rate assumption for the five-year reversion to the mean period been readjusted to a floor of zero percent, pre-tax income would have been lower by approximately $30 million. For variable annuities in our Retirement Income Solutions product line, the assumed annual growth rate has remained above zero percent for the five-year reversion to the mean period, so it has not met our criteria for adjustment; however, additional favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could also result in “unlocking” in this product line in future periods with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.\nThe following table summarizes the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions in the amortization of DAC, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and URR, and the related hypothetical impact on year-end 2014 balances. The effect of changes in net investment spread primarily affects our Fixed Annuities product line. Changes in equity returns, volatility and interest rates primarily impact reserves for guarantee features of variable annuities in our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines. The effect of changes in mortality primarily impacts the universal life insurance business.\nGuaranteed\nUnearned\nNet\nDecember 31, 2014\nBenefits\nRevenue\nPre-Tax\n(in millions)\nDAC/SIA\nReserve\nLiability\nEarnings\nAssumptions:\nNet Investment Spread\nEffect of an increase by 10 basis points\n$\n$\n(5)\n$\n$\nEffect of a decrease by 10 basis points\n(120)\n(5)\n(120)\nEquity Return(a)\nEffect of an increase by 1%\n(55)\n-\nEffect of a decrease by 1%\n(37)\n-\n(93)\nVolatility (b)\nEffect of an increase by 1%\n-\n-\n(14)\nEffect of a decrease by 1%\n-\n(14)\n-\nInterest Rate(c)\nEffect of an increase by 10 basis points\n-\n(134)\n-\nEffect of a decrease by 10 basis points\n-\n-\n(134)\nMortality\nEffect of an increase by 1%\n(9)\n(2)\n(29)\nEffect of a decrease by 1%\n(22)\n(a) Represents the net impact of 1 percent increase or decrease in long-term equity returns for GMDB and GMIB reserves and negligible net impact of 1 percent increase or decrease in the S&P 500 index for living benefit reserves.\n(b) Represents the net impact of 1 percentage point increase or decrease in implied volatility.\n(c) Represents the net impact of 10 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve on the reserves for GMWB and GMAV living benefit features. Does not represent interest rate spread compression on investment-oriented products.\nThe analysis of DAC, guaranteed benefits reserve and unearned revenue liability is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described above. We estimate each of the above factors individually, without the effect of\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nany correlation among the key assumptions. An assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results. The effects on pre-tax earnings in the sensitivity analysis table above do not reflect the related effects from our economic hedging program, which utilizes derivative and other financial instruments and is designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the guaranteed benefit embedded derivative liabilities. For a further discussion on guaranteed benefit features of our variable annuities, our dynamic hedging program and risks of AIG’s unhedged exposures, see Item 1A. - Risk Factors - Business and Operations and Notes 5 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment Charges\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available For Sale Securities\nAt each balance sheet date, we evaluate our available for sale securities holdings with unrealized losses.\nSee the discussion in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the methodology and significant inputs, by security type, that we use to determine the amount of other-than-temporary impairment on fixed maturity and equity securities.\nImpairments on Investments in Life Settlements\nImpairments to investments in life settlements may occur in the future due to the fact that continued payment of premiums required to maintain policies will cause the expected lifetime undiscounted cash flows for some policies to become negative in future reporting periods, even in the absence of future changes to the mortality assumptions. Impairments may also occur due to our future sale or lapse of select policies at a value that is below carrying amount.\nFor a discussion of impairments on investments in life settlements, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Impairment\nFor a discussion of goodwill impairment, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2014 and 2013, AIG elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. To determine fair value, we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings. Such analysis is principally based on AIG’s business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends.\nLiability for Legal Contingencies\nWe estimate and record a liability for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters.\nFor more information on legal, regulatory and litigation matters, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nFair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and our accounting policy regarding the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements.\nThe following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities by source of value determination:\nDecember 31, 2014\nFair\nPercent\n(in billions)\nValue\nof Total\nFair value based on external sources(a)\n$\n%\nFair value based on internal sources\nTotal fixed maturity and equity securities(b)\n$\n%\n(a) Includes $27.3 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.\n(b) Includes available for sale and other securities.\nLevel 3 Assets and Liabilities\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three “levels” based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value.

Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.\nWe classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as Level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as a discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.\nItem 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\nGlossary\nAccident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.\nAccident year combined ratio, as adjusted The combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.\nAccident year loss ratio, as adjusted The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.\nAcquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of value of business acquired (VOBA) and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC). Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs, certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting, and the change in DAC. Acquisition costs that are incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are deferred and recognized over the coverage periods of related insurance contracts. Acquisition costs that are not incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are recognized as incurred.\nBase Spread Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets.\nBET Binomial Expansion Technique A model that generates expected loss estimates for CDO tranches and derives a credit rating for those tranches.\nBook Value Per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) (AOCI) is a non-GAAP measure and is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis.

Also, the CVA reflects the fair value movement in the DIB’s asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Finally, the CVA also accounts for our own credit risk, in the fair value measurement of all net derivative liabilities positions and liabilities where AIG has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.\nDAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business.\nDAC Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments An adjustment to DAC for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (also referred to as “shadow DAC”). The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments that is credited or charged directly to Other comprehensive income (loss).\nExpense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned.\nFirst-Lien Priority over all other liens or claims on a property in the event of default on a mortgage.\nGeneral operating expense ratio General operating expenses divided by net premiums earned.

Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is presented as Unearned premium reserves in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNonbank SIFI Nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institutions Financial institutions are deemed nonbank systemically important (that is, the failure of the financial institution could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council based on a three-stage analytical process.\nNoncontrolling interest The portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company.\nPolicy fees An amount added to a policy premium, or deducted from a policy cash value or contract holder account, to reflect the cost of issuing a policy, establishing the required records, sending premium notices and other related expenses.\nPool A reinsurance arrangement whereby all of the underwriting results of the pool members are combined and then shared by each member in accordance with its pool participation percentage. Prior to January 1, 2014, AIG maintained two pools (the admitted lines pool and the surplus lines pool. Our members in the admitted lines pool are licensed to write standard lines of business by the individual state departments of insurance, and the policy forms and rates are regulated by those departments.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, AIG maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). AIG’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A in the 2014 Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on AIG’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 20, 2015\nItem 8 / REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance SheetS\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except for share data)\nAssets:\nInvestments:\nFixed maturity securities:\nBonds available for sale, at fair value (amortized cost: 2014 - $243,307; 2013 - $248,531)\n$\n259,859\n$\n258,274\nOther bond securities, at fair value (See Note 6)\n19,712\n22,623\nEquity Securities:\nCommon and preferred stock available for sale, at fair value (cost: 2014 - $1,930; 2013 - $1,726)\n4,395\n3,656\nOther common and preferred stock, at fair value (See Note 6)\n1,049\nMortgage and other loans receivable, net of allowance (portion measured at fair value: 2014 - $6; 2013 - $0)\n24,990\n20,765\nOther invested assets (portion measured at fair value: 2014 - $9,394; 2013 - $8,598)\n34,518\n28,659\nShort-term investments (portion measured at fair value: 2014 - $1,684; 2013 - $6,313)\n11,243\n21,617\nTotal investments\n355,766\n356,428\nCash\n1,758\n2,241\nAccrued investment income\n2,712\n2,905\nPremiums and other receivables, net of allowance\n12,031\n12,939\nReinsurance assets, net of allowance\n21,959\n23,829\nDeferred income taxes\n19,339\n21,925\nDeferred policy acquisition costs\n9,827\n9,436\nDerivative assets, at fair value\n1,604\n1,665\nOther assets, including restricted cash of $2,025 in 2014 and $865 in 2013 (portion measured at fair value:\n2014 - $0; 2013 - $418)\n10,549\n9,366\nSeparate account assets, at fair value\n80,036\n71,059\nAssets held for sale\n-\n29,536\nTotal assets\n$\n515,581\n$\n541,329\nLiabilities:\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n$\n77,260\n$\n81,547\nUnearned premiums\n21,324\n21,953\nFuture policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts\n42,749\n40,653\nPolicyholder contract deposits (portion measured at fair value: 2014 - $1,561; 2013 - $384)\n124,613\n122,016\nOther policyholder funds (portion measured at fair value: 2014 - $8; 2013 - $0)\n4,669\n5,083\nDerivative liabilities, at fair value\n2,273\n2,511\nOther liabilities (portion measured at fair value: 2014 - $350; 2013 - $933)\n24,168\n29,155\nLong-term debt (portion measured at fair value: 2014 - $5,466; 2013 - $6,747)\n31,217\n41,693\nSeparate account liabilities\n80,036\n71,059\nLiabilities held for sale\n-\n24,548\nTotal liabilities\n408,309\n440,218\nContingencies, commitments and guarantees (see Note 16)\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests (see Note 18)\n-\nAIG shareholders’ equity:\nCommon stock, $2.50 par value; 5,000,000,000 shares authorized; shares issued: 2014 - 1,906,671,492 and\n2013 - 1,906,645,689\n4,766\n4,766\nTreasury stock, at cost; 2014 - 530,744,521; 2013 - 442,582,366 shares of common stock\n(19,218)\n(14,520)\nAdditional paid-in capital\n80,958\n80,899\nRetained earnings\n29,775\n22,965\nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n10,617\n6,360\nTotal AIG shareholders’ equity\n106,898\n100,470\nNon-redeemable noncontrolling interests (including $100 associated with businesses held for sale in 2013)\nTotal equity\n107,272\n101,081\nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n515,581\n$\n541,329\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAmerican International Group, Inc.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nAmerican International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading global insurance organization serving customers in more than 100 countries and jurisdictions. AIG companies serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through one of the most extensive worldwide property-casualty networks of any insurer. In addition, AIG companies are leading providers of life insurance and retirement services in the United States. AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AIG) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “AIG,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean American International Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and the term “AIG Parent” means American International Group, Inc. and not any of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIG Parent, our controlled subsidiaries (generally through a greater than 50 percent ownership of voting rights of a voting interest entity), and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which we are the primary beneficiary. Equity investments in entities that we do not consolidate, including corporate entities in which we have significant influence and partnership and partnership-like entities in which we have more than minor influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method unless we have elected the fair value option.\nCertain of our foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements report on different annual fiscal year bases, in most cases ending November 30. The effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations of all material events occurring at these subsidiaries between such fiscal year end and December 31st for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements has been recorded.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nSegment changes are discussed in Note 3 herein.\nPresentation Changes\nPolicy fees related to features accounted for as embedded derivatives in variable annuity products, including guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits and guaranteed minimum account value benefits, are included in the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives. Effective December 31, 2014, we reclassified fees related to these embedded derivatives to Net realized capital gains, with no effect to the fair value measurement of the embedded derivatives, Income from continuing operations, Net income attributable to AIG, or Shareholders’ equity. Accordingly, a portion of prior period policy fees have been reclassified to Net realized capital gains to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 14 herein for our accounting policy and Note 5 for a discussion of the fair value measurement of embedded policy derivatives, including policy on classification of fees.\nRevisions were made to change the classification of certain miscellaneous income from General operating and other expenses to Premiums and of certain broker-dealer fees from General operating and other expenses to Other income, to conform with the current period presentation, with no effect to Income from continuing operations or Net income attributable to AIG.\nSale of ILFC\nOn May 14, 2014, we completed the sale of 100 percent of the common stock of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) to AerCap Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap), in exchange for total consideration of approximately $7.6 billion, including cash and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares (the AerCap Transaction). The total value of the consideration was based in part on AerCap’s closing price per share of $47.01 on May 13, 2014. ILFC’s results of operations are reflected in Aircraft leasing revenue and Aircraft leasing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income through the date of the completion of the sale. ILFC’s assets and liabilities were classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2013 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 herein for further discussion.\nItem 8 / note 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions are considered our critical accounting estimates and are related to the determination of:\n• classification of ILFC as held for sale and related fair value measurement for applicable years;\n• income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;\n• liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses;\n• reinsurance assets;\n• valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition;\n• valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products;\n• estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products;\n• impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on investments in life settlements and goodwill impairment;\n• liability for legal contingencies; and\n• fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.\nThese accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following table identifies our significant accounting policies presented in other Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, with a reference to the Note where a detailed description can be found:\nNote 4.\nHeld-for-Sale Classification, Divested Businesses and Discontinued Operations\n· Held-for-sale classification\n· Discontinued operations\nNote 6.\nInvestments\n· Fixed maturity and equity securities\n· Other invested assets\n· Short-term investments\n· Net investment income\n· Net realized capital gains (losses)\n· Other-than-temporary impairments\nNote 7.\nLending Activities\n· Mortgage and other loans receivable - net of allowance\nNote 8.\nReinsurance\n· Reinsurance assets - net of allowance\nNote 9.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\n· Deferred policy acquisition costs\n· Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\nNote 11.\nDerivatives and Hedge Accounting\n· Derivative assets and liabilities, at fair value\nNote 12.\nGoodwill\nNote 13.\nInsurance Liabilities\n· Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n· Discounting of reserves\n· Future policy benefits\n· Policyholder contract deposits\n· Other policyholder funds\nNote 14\nVariable Life and Annuity Contracts\nNote 15.\nDebt\n· Long-term debt\nNote 16.\nContingencies, Commitments and Guarantees\n· Legal contingencies\nNote 18.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNote 19.\nEarnings Per Share\nNote 24.\nIncome Taxes\nItem 8 / note 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOther significant accounting policies\nPremiums for short-duration contracts are recorded as written on the inception date of the policy. Premiums are earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. Sales of extended services contracts are reflected as premiums written and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. In addition, certain miscellaneous income is included as premiums written and earned. The reserve for unearned premiums includes the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage. Reinsurance premiums are typically earned over the same period as the underlying policies or risks covered by the contract. As a result, the earnings pattern of a reinsurance contract may extend up to 24 months, reflecting the inception dates of the underlying policies throughout the year.\nReinsurance premiums ceded are recognized as a reduction in revenues over the period the reinsurance coverage is provided in proportion to the risks to which the premiums relate.\nPremiums for long-duration insurance products and life contingent annuities are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for premiums due but not yet collected are accrued.\nPolicy fees represent fees recognized from universal life and investment-type products consisting of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration charges, surrender charges and amortization of unearned revenue reserves.\nAircraft leasing revenue from flight equipment under operating leases, through May 14, 2014, the date of disposal of ILFC, was recognized over the life of the leases as rental payments became receivable under the provisions of the leases or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the leases. In certain cases, leases provided for additional payments contingent on usage. In those cases, rental revenue was recognized at the time such usage occurred, net of estimated future contractual aircraft maintenance reimbursements. Gains on sales of flight equipment were recognized when flight equipment was sold and the risk of ownership of the equipment passed to the new owner.\nOther income includes unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, including income from the Direct Investment book (DIB) unrealized market valuation gains and losses associated with the Global Capital Markets (GCM) super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio, advisory fee income from the Consumer Insurance broker dealer business, as well as legal settlements of $804 million, $1.2 billion and $200 million from legacy crisis and other matters in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nOther income from our Corporate and Other category consists of the following:\n• Change in fair value relating to financial assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected.\n• Interest income and related expenses, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on bonds with changes in the timing and the amount of expected principal and interest cash flows reflected in the yield, as applicable.\n• Dividend income from common and preferred stock and distributions from other investments.\n• Changes in the fair value of other securities sold but not yet purchased, futures, hybrid financial instruments, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\nItem 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n• Income earned on real estate based investments and related realized gains and losses from sales, property level impairments and financing costs.\n• Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions.\n• Earnings from private equity funds and hedge fund investments accounted for under the equity method.\n• Gains and losses recognized in earnings on derivatives for the effective portion and their related hedged items.\nAircraft leasing expenses through May 14, 2014, the date of disposal of ILFC, consisted of ILFC interest expense, depreciation expense, impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses incurred by ILFC.\nCash represents cash on hand and non-interest- bearing demand deposits.\nPremiums and other receivables - net of allowance include premium balances receivable, amounts due from agents and brokers and policyholders, trade receivables for the DIB and GCM and other receivables. Trade receivables for GCM include cash collateral posted to derivative counterparties that is not eligible to be netted against derivative liabilities. The allowance for doubtful accounts on premiums and other receivables was $428 million and $554 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOther assets consist of sales inducement assets, prepaid expenses, deposits, other deferred charges, real estate, other fixed assets, capitalized software costs, goodwill, intangible assets other than goodwill, and restricted cash.\nWe offer sales inducements which include enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders (bonus interest) on certain annuity and investment contract products. Sales inducements provided to the contract holder are recognized in Policyholder contract deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC (see Note 9 herein). To qualify for such accounting treatment, the bonus interest must be explicitly identified in the contract at inception. We must also demonstrate that such amounts are incremental to amounts we credit on similar contracts without bonus interest, and are higher than the contract’s expected ongoing crediting rates for periods after the bonus period. The deferred bonus interest and other deferred sales inducement assets totaled $629 million and $703 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The amortization expense associated with these assets is reported within Interest credited to policyholder account balances in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such amortization expense totaled $63 million, $102 million and $162 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nThe cost of buildings and furniture and equipment is depreciated principally on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred and expenditures for improvements are capitalized and depreciated. We periodically assess the carrying amount of our real estate for purposes of determining any asset impairment. Capitalized software costs, which represent costs directly related to obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software, are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over a period generally not exceeding five years. Real estate, fixed assets and other long-lived assets are assessed for impairment when impairment indicators exist.\nSeparate accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who bear the investment risk. Each account has specific investment objectives and the assets are carried at fair value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise from any of our other businesses. The liabilities for these accounts are equal to the account assets. For a more detailed discussion of separate accounts, see Note 14 herein.\nOther liabilities consist of other funds on deposit, other payables, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities sold but not yet purchased. We have entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in our Non-Life Insurance Companies segment, that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance. Accordingly, the premiums received on such contracts, after deduction for certain related expenses, are recorded as deposits within Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net proceeds of these deposits are invested and generate Net investment income. As amounts are paid, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit liability is reduced. Also included in Other liabilities are trade payables for the DIB and GCM, which include option premiums received and payables to counterparties that relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards, and options and balances due to\nItem 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nclearing brokers and exchanges. Trade payables for GCM also include cash collateral received from derivative counterparties that contractually cannot be netted against derivative assets.\nSecurities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at fair value. Fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.\nForeign currency: Financial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. Functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any related taxes, in Total AIG shareholders’ equity. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Financial statement accounts expressed in currencies other than the functional currency of a consolidated entity are translated into that entity’s functional currency. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates during the period. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in income.\nAccounting Standards Adopted During 2014\nCertain Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements\nIn February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard that requires us to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date as the sum of (i) the amount we agreed to pay on the basis of our arrangement among our co-obligors and (ii) any additional amount we expect to pay on behalf of our co-obligors.\nWe adopted the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nParent’s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of an Investment within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity\nIn March 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard addressing whether consolidation guidance or foreign currency guidance applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent sells all or a part of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or net assets that are a business (other than a sale of in-substance real estate) within a foreign entity. The standard also resolves the diversity in practice for the cumulative translation adjustment treatment in business combinations achieved in stages involving foreign entities.\nUnder the standard, the entire amount of the cumulative translation adjustment associated with the foreign entity should be released into earnings when there has been: (i) a sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or the net assets had resided; (ii) a loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity; or (iii) a change in accounting method from applying the equity method to an investment in a foreign entity to consolidating the foreign entity.\nWe adopted the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2014 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nInvestment Company Guidance\nIn June 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amends the criteria a company must meet to qualify as an investment company, clarifies the measurement guidance, and requires new disclosures for investment companies. An entity that is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act)\nItem 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nqualifies as an investment company. Entities that are not regulated under the 1940 Act must have certain fundamental characteristics and must consider other characteristics to determine whether they qualify as investment companies. An entity’s purpose and design must be considered when making the assessment.\nAn entity that no longer meets the requirements to be an investment company as a result of this standard should present the change in its status as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. An entity that is an investment company should apply the standard prospectively as an adjustment to opening net assets as of the effective date. The adjustment to net assets represents both the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the entity’s investments and any amount previously recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income.\nWe adopted the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2014 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPresentation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nIn July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires a liability related to unrecognized tax benefits to be presented as a reduction to the related deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward. When the carryforwards are not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit will be presented in the financial statements as a liability and will not be combined with the related deferred tax asset.\nWe adopted the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2014 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFuture Application of Accounting Standards\nReclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure\nIn January 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that clarifies that a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, so that the loan is derecognized and the real estate property is recognized, when either (i) the creditor obtains legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (ii) the borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.\nThe standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2015 and do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nReporting Discontinued Operations\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that changes the requirements for presenting a component or group of components of an entity as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures. Under the standard, the disposal of a component or group of components of an entity should be reported as a discontinued operation if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. Disposals of equity method investments, or those reported as held-for-sale, must be presented as a discontinued operation if they meet the new definition. The standard also requires entities to provide disclosures about the disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation.\nThe standard is effective prospectively for all disposals of components (or classification of components as held-for-sale) of an entity that occur within interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications of components as held-for-sale) that have not been reported in financial statements\nItem 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\npreviously issued. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2015 and do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard excludes from its scope the accounting for insurance contracts, leases, financial instruments, and other agreements that are governed under other GAAP guidance, but affects the revenue recognition for certain of our other activities.\nThe standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the date of adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2017 and are assessing the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRepurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and repurchase financing arrangements. It also requires additional disclosures about repurchase agreements and other similar transactions. The standard aligns the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and repurchase agreements executed as a repurchase financing with the accounting for other typical repurchase agreements such that they all will be accounted for as secured borrowings. The standard eliminates sale accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and supersedes the standard under which a transfer of a financial asset and a contemporaneous repurchase financing could be accounted for on a combined basis as a forward agreement.\nThe accounting standard and new disclosure requirements for certain transactions accounted for as sales are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, while the disclosure requirements for transactions accounted for as secured borrowings are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and for interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015. Early adoption is not permitted. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective dates and do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAccounting for Share-Based Payments with Performance Targets\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that clarifies the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The standard requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.\nThe standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The standard may be applied prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2016 and do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMeasuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that allows a reporting entity to measure the financial assets and financial liabilities of a qualifying consolidated collateralized financing entity using the fair value of either its financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable.\nItem 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The standard may be applied retrospectively to all relevant prior periods presented starting with January 1, 2010 or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the date of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2016 and are assessing the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows\nConsolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard that affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities; eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.\nThe standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The standard may be applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2016 and are assessing the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n3. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed our previously announced reorganization and modified the presentation of our financial results to reflect our new operating structure. The new operating structure includes two reportable segments - Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance - and a Corporate and Other category. The Corporate and Other category consists of businesses and items not allocated to our reportable segments.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2014, AIG reported its results through two reportable segments - AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement. The AIG Property Casualty reportable segment had two operating segments - Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance in addition to an AIG Property Casualty Other category. The AIG Life and Retirement reportable segment had two operating segments - Retail and Institutional.\nWe evaluate performance based on revenues and pre-tax operating income (loss). Pre-tax operating income (loss) is derived by excluding certain items from net income (loss) attributable to AIG. See the table below for the items excluded from pre-tax operating income.\nTo align our financial reporting with the manner in which AIG’s chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, the Commercial and Consumer reportable segments are presented as three operating segments for each reportable segment as follows:\nCommercial Insurance\nThe Commercial Insurance segment is presented as three operating segments:\n• Property Casualty - previously included as part of AIG Property Casualty’s Commercial operating segment\n• Mortgage Guaranty - previously reported within the Corporate and Other Category\n• Institutional Markets - previously reported in AIG Life and Retirement’s Institutional operating segment\nItem 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nProperty Casualty products are primarily distributed through a network of independent retail and wholesale brokers, and through an independent agency network. Mortgage Guaranty products and services are provided to mortgage lenders including mortgage banks, credit unions and finance agencies. Institutional Markets products are marketed primarily through specialized marketing and consulting firms and structured settlement brokers.\nConsumer Insurance\nThe Consumer Insurance segment is presented as three operating segments:\n• Retirement - consists of the product lines Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions, Group Retirement, and Retail Mutual Funds and Advisory Services, previously included in AIG Life and Retirement’s Retail and Institutional operating segments.\n• Life - consists of businesses previously included in AIG Life and Retirement’s Retail operating segment as well as the international life business previously included in AIG Property Casualty’s Consumer operating segment.\n• Personal Insurance - consists of Personal Lines and Accident & Health product lines previously reported as a component of AIG Property Casualty’s Consumer operating segment.\nRetirement and Life products are distributed through a unified multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, broker-dealers, independent marking organizations, financial advisors, independent insurance agents and career agents. Personal insurance products are distributed primarily through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing and partner organizations.\nInvestment income is allocated between the Property Casualty and Personal Insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and allocated capital.\nThe run-off insurance businesses previously reported in AIG Property Casualty’s Other category are now presented in Corporate and Other.\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate and Other includes results from:\n• Direct Investment book\n• Global Capital Markets\n• Retained Interests, which represent the fair value gains or losses, prior to their sale in 2012, of the AIA Group Limited (AIA) ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering; the MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities that were received as consideration from the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO); and the fair value gains or losses, prior to the FRBNY liquidation of Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) assets, on the retained interest in ML III\n• AIG Parent, Run-off Insurance Lines, and Other, and\n• Aircraft Leasing through May 14, 2014, the date of our sale of ILFC.\nCertain of our management activities, such as investment management, enterprise risk management, liquidity management and capital management, and our balance sheet reporting, are conducted on a legal entity basis. We group our insurance-related legal entities into two categories: Non-Life Insurance Companies, and Life Insurance Companies.\nNon-Life Insurance Companies include the following major property casualty and mortgage guaranty companies: National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa.(National Union); American Home Assurance Company (American Home); Lexington Insurance Company (Lexington); Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji Fire); American Home Assurance Company, Ltd. (American Home Japan); AIG Asia Pacific Insurance, Pte, Ltd.; AIG Europe Limited and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company (UGRIC).\nItem 8 / note 3. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nLife Insurance Companies include the following major operating companies: American General Life Insurance Company (American General Life); The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC); The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (U.S. Life) and AIG Fuji Life Insurance Company Limited (Fuji Life).\nPrior periods have been revised to conform to the current period presentation for the above segment changes.\nThe following table presents AIG’s continuing operations by reportable segment:\nNet\nDepreciation\nPre-Tax\nTotal\nInvestment\nInterest\nand\nOperating\n(in millions)\nRevenues\nIncome\nExpense\nAmortization\nIncome (Loss)\nCommercial Insurance\nProperty Casualty\n$\n25,183\n$\n4,298\n$\n-\n$\n2,445\n$\n4,248\nMortgage Guaranty\n1,042\n-\nInstitutional Markets\n2,576\n1,957\n(215)\nTotal Commercial Insurance\n28,801\n6,393\n2,286\n5,510\nConsumer Insurance\nRetirement\n9,784\n6,489\n(231)\n3,495\nLife\n6,321\n2,199\nPersonal Insurance\n12,364\n2,067\nTotal Consumer Insurance\n28,469\n9,082\n1,966\n4,474\nCorporate and Other\nDirect Investment book\n1,479\n-\n(40)\n1,241\nGlobal Capital Markets\n-\n-\n-\nAIG Parent and Other*\n2,960\n1,598\n(1,989)\nAircraft Leasing\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nConsolidation and elimination\n(716)\n-\n(11)\n-\nTotal Corporate and Other\n4,197\n1,805\n(388)\nAIG Consolidation and elimination\n(466)\n(356)\n(126)\n(181)\n(22)\nTotal AIG Consolidated pre-tax operating income\n$\n61,001\n$\n15,819\n$\n1,718\n$\n4,417\n$\n9,574\nReconciling Items from pre-tax operating income to pre-tax income:\nChanges in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge\nliving benefit liabilities, net of interest expense\n-\n-\nChanges in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to\nnet realized capital gains\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(217)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(2,282)\nNet realized capital gains\n-\n-\n-\nIncome from divested businesses\n1,602\n-\n-\n2,169\nLegal settlements related to legacy crisis matters\n-\n-\n-\nLegal reserves related to legacy crisis matters\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(546)\nPre-tax income\n$\n64,406\n$\n16,079\n$\n1,718\n$\n4,448\n$\n10,501\nCommercial Insurance\nProperty Casualty\n$\n25,108\n$\n4,431\n$\n$\n2,393\n$\n4,095\nMortgage Guaranty\n-\nInstitutional Markets\n2,813\n2,090\n(160)\nTotal Commercial Insurance\n28,862\n6,653\n2,283\n4,980\nConsumer Insurance\nRetirement\n9,431\n6,628\n(165)\n3,490\nLife\n6,397\n2,269\nPersonal Insurance\n12,832\n2,110\nTotal Consumer Insurance\n28,660\n9,352\n2,159\n4,564\nCorporate and Other\nDirect Investment book\n1,825\n-\n(80)\n1,448\nGlobal Capital Markets\n-\n-\n-\nAIG Parent and Other*\n1,908\n2,112\n(2,396)\nAircraft Leasing\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nConsolidation and elimination\n(547)\n-\n(14)\n-\nTotal Corporate and Other\n4,019\n2,451\n(319)\nAIG Consolidation and elimination\n(17)\n(343)\n(328)\n(26)\nTotal AIG Consolidated pre-tax operating income\n$\n61,524\n$\n15,971\n$\n2,142\n$\n4,637\n$\n9,390\nReconciling Items from pre-tax operating income to pre-tax income:\nChanges in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge\nliving benefit liabilities, net of interest expense\n(161)\n(161)\n-\n-\n(161)\nChanges in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to\nnet realized capital gains\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(1,608)\nOther income (expense) -

HELD-FOR-SALE CLASSIFICATION, Divested Businesses AND Discontinued Operations\nHeld-For-Sale Classification\nWe report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the next 12 months and certain other specified criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded on assets of a business after it is classified as held for sale. Assets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale.\nThe following table summarizes the components of ILFC assets and liabilities held-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nAssets:\nEquity securities\n$\nMortgage and other loans receivable, net\nFlight equipment primarily under operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation\n35,508\nShort-term investments\nCash\nPremiums and other receivables, net of allowance\nOther assets\n2,066\nAssets held for sale\n38,870\nLess: Loss accrual\n(9,334)\nTotal assets held for sale\n$\n29,536\nLiabilities:\nOther liabilities\n$\n3,127\nLong-term debt\n21,421\nTotal liabilities held for sale\n$\n24,548\nInternational Lease Finance Corporation\nOn May 14, 2014, we completed the sale of 100 percent of the common stock of ILFC to AerCap Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AerCap, in exchange for total consideration of approximately $7.6 billion, including cash and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares, valued at approximately $4.6 billion based on AerCap’s closing price per share of $47.01 on May 13, 2014. Net cash proceeds to AIG were $2.4 billion after the settlement of intercompany loans, and AIG recorded pre-tax and after-tax gains of approximately $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, for the year ended December\nItem 8 / note 3. SEGMENT INFORMATION\n31, 2014. In connection with the AerCap Transaction, we entered into a five-year credit agreement for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap Ireland Capital Limited, as borrower, and AIG Parent as lender (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment of $1.0 billion and permits loans for general corporate purposes after the closing of the AerCap Transaction. At December 31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs a result of the AerCap Transaction, we own approximately 46 percent of the outstanding common stock of AerCap. This common stock is subject to certain restrictions as to the amount and timing of potential sales as set forth in the Stockholders’ Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement between AIG and AerCap. We account for our interest in AerCap using the equity method of accounting. The difference between the carrying amount of our investment in AerCap common stock and our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of AerCap was approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014. Approximately $0.4 billion of this difference was allocated to the assets and liabilities of AerCap based on their respective fair values and is being amortized into income over the estimated lives of the related assets and liabilities. The remainder was allocated to goodwill.\nILFC’s results of operations are reflected in Aircraft leasing revenue and Aircraft leasing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income through the date of the completion of the sale. ILFC’s assets and liabilities were classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2013 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe report the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if the business is classified as held for sale, the operations and cash flows of the business have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations as a result of a disposal transaction and we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transaction. The results of discontinued operations are reported in Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the business meets the criteria of a discontinued operation, and include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.\nThe results of operations for the following business is presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn connection with the 2010 sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife), we recognized the following income (loss) from discontinued operations:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nGain on sale\n$\n$\n$\nIncome from discontinued operations, before income tax expense\nIncome tax expense\n-\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense\n$\n(50)\n$\n$\n5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\nWe carry certain of our financial instruments at fair value. We define the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We are responsible for the determination of the value of the investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions.\nThe degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally inversely correlates with the level of observable valuation inputs. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\nItem 8 / note 4. HELD-FOR-SALE CLASSIFICATION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nmeasuring fair value. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments for which no quoted prices are available have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, liquidity and general market conditions.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured and classified in accordance with a fair value hierarchy consisting of three “levels” based on the observability of valuation inputs:\n• Level 1: Fair value measurements based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that we have the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. Market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for such instruments.\n• Level 2: Fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n• Level 3: Fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable. Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair values of positions classified in Level 3. The circumstances for using these measurements include those in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Therefore, we must make certain assumptions about the inputs a hypothetical market participant would use to value that asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments carried at fair value. These methodologies are applied to assets and liabilities across the levels discussed above, and it is the observability of the inputs used that determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability.\nValuation Methodologies of Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\nIncorporation of Credit Risk in Fair Value Measurements\n• Our Own Credit Risk. Fair value measurements for certain liabilities incorporate our own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against its net credit exposure to us at the balance sheet date by reference to observable AIG CDS or cash bond spreads. A derivative counterparty’s net credit exposure to us is determined based on master netting agreements, when applicable, which take into consideration all derivative positions with us, as well as collateral we post with the counterparty at the balance sheet date. We calculate the effect of these credit spread changes using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate current market interest rates.\n• Counterparty Credit Risk. Fair value measurements for freestanding derivatives incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for us to protect against our net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty CDS spreads, when available. When not available, other directly or indirectly observable credit spreads will be used to derive the best estimates of the counterparty spreads. Our net credit exposure to a counterparty is determined based on master netting agreements, which take into consideration all derivative positions with the counterparty, as well as collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date.\nFair values for fixed maturity securities based on observable market prices for identical or similar instruments implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk. Fair values for fixed maturity securities based on internal models incorporate counterparty\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\ncredit risk by using discount rates that take into consideration cash issuance spreads for similar instruments or other observable information.\nThe cost of credit protection is determined under a discounted present value approach considering the market levels for single name CDS spreads for each specific counterparty, the mid market value of the net exposure (reflecting the amount of protection required) and the weighted average life of the net exposure. CDS spreads are provided to us by an independent third party. We utilize an interest rate based on the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) curve to derive our discount rates.\nWhile this approach does not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transactions or potential future changes in valuation inputs, we believe this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities, including consideration of the impact of non-performance risk.\nFixed Maturity Securities\nWhenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure fixed maturity securities at fair value. Market price data is generally obtained from dealer markets.\nWe employ independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information to derive fair value estimates for individual investments, based upon market-accepted methodologies and assumptions. The methodologies used by these independent third-party valuation service providers are reviewed and understood by management, through periodic discussion with and information provided by the independent third-party valuation service providers. In addition, as discussed further below, control processes are applied to the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers to ensure the accuracy of these values.\nValuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of market-accepted valuation methodologies, which may utilize matrix pricing, financial models, accompanying model inputs and various assumptions, provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from completed transactions for identical securities and transactions for comparable securities, benchmark yields, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, prepayment rates, default rates, currency rates, quoted prices for similar securities and other market-observable information, as applicable. If fair value is determined using financial models, these models generally take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued, including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and when applicable, collateral quality and other security or issuer-specific information. When market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased.\nWe have control processes designed to ensure that the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers are accurately recorded, that their data inputs and valuation techniques are appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions used appear reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value. We assess the reasonableness of individual security values received from independent third-party valuation service providers through various analytical techniques, and have procedures to escalate related questions internally and to the independent third-party valuation service providers for resolution. To assess the degree of pricing consensus among various valuation service providers for specific asset types, we conduct comparisons of prices received from available sources. We use these comparisons to establish a hierarchy for the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers to be used for particular security classes. We also validate prices for selected securities through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions.\nWhen our independent third-party valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a price quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing market accepted valuation models. Broker prices may be based on an income approach, which converts expected future cash flows to a single present value amount, with specific consideration of inputs relevant to particular security types. For structured securities, such inputs may include ratings, collateral types, geographic concentrations, underlying loan vintages, loan delinquencies and defaults, prepayments, and weighted average coupons and maturities. When the volume or level of market\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nactivity for a security is limited, certain inputs used to determine fair value may not be observable in the market. Broker prices may also be based on a market approach that considers recent transactions involving identical or similar securities. Fair values provided by brokers are subject to similar control processes to those noted above for fair values from independent third-party valuation service providers, including management reviews. For those corporate debt instruments (for example, private placements) that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations reflect illiquidity and non-transferability, based on available market evidence. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models using discount rates based on credit spreads, yields or price levels of comparable securities, adjusted for illiquidity and structure. Fair values determined internally are also subject to management review to ensure that valuation models and related inputs are reasonable.\nThe methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity securities including residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS), collateralized debt obligations (CDO), other asset-backed securities (ABS) and fixed maturity securities issued by government sponsored entities and corporate entities.\nEquity Securities Traded in Active Markets\nWhenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure equity securities at fair value. Market price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer markets.\nMortgage and Other Loans Receivable\nWe estimate the fair value of mortgage and other loans receivable that are measured at fair value by using dealer quotations, discounted cash flow analyses and/or internal valuation models. The determination of fair value considers inputs such as interest rate, maturity, the borrower’s creditworthiness, collateral, subordination, guarantees, past-due status, yield curves, credit curves, prepayment rates, market pricing for comparable loans and other relevant factors.\nOther Invested Assets\nWe initially estimate the fair value of investments in certain hedge funds, private equity funds and other investment partnerships by reference to the transaction price. Subsequently, we generally obtain the fair value of these investments from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which are generally audited annually. We consider observable market data and perform certain control procedures to validate the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement. The fair values of other investments carried at fair value, such as direct private equity holdings, are initially determined based on transaction price and are subsequently estimated based on available evidence such as market transactions in similar instruments, other financing transactions of the issuer and other available financial information for the issuer, with adjustments made to reflect illiquidity as appropriate.\nShort-term Investments\nFor short-term investments that are measured at amortized cost, the carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk. Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) are generally treated as collateralized receivables. We report certain receivables arising from securities purchased under agreements to resell as Short-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When these receivables are measured at fair value, we use market-observable interest rates to determine fair value.\nSeparate Account Assets\nSeparate account assets are composed primarily of registered and unregistered open-end mutual funds that generally trade daily and are measured at fair value in the manner discussed above for equity securities traded in active markets.\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFreestanding Derivatives\nDerivative assets and liabilities can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). We generally value exchange-traded derivatives such as futures and options using quoted prices in active markets for identical derivatives at the balance sheet date.\nOTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. When models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We generally use similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.\nFor certain OTC derivatives that trade in less liquid markets, where we generally do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions, the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price. We will update valuation inputs in these models only when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, independent third-party valuation service providers and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is used.\nEmbedded Policy Derivatives\nCertain variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity and life contracts contain embedded policy derivatives that we bifurcate from the host contracts and account for separately at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. These embedded derivatives are classified within Policyholder contract deposits. We have concluded these contracts contain (i) written option guarantees on minimum accumulation value, (ii) a series of written options that guarantee withdrawals from the highest anniversary value within a specific period or for life, or (iii) equity-indexed written options that meet the criteria of derivatives that must be bifurcated.\nThe fair value of embedded policy derivatives contained in certain variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity and life contracts is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. These cash flow estimates primarily include benefits and related fees assessed, when applicable, and incorporate expectations about policyholder behavior. Estimates of future policyholder behavior are subjective and based primarily on our historical experience.\nWith respect to embedded policy derivatives in our variable annuity contracts, because of the dynamic and complex nature of the expected cash flows, risk neutral valuations are used. Estimating the underlying cash flows for these products involves judgments regarding expected market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market variables to funds, fund performance, discount rates and policyholder behavior. The portion of fees attributable to the fair value of expected benefit payments are included within the fair value measurement of these embedded policy derivatives and related fees are classified in net realized gain/loss as collected consistent with other changes in the fair value of these embedded policy derivatives. Any additional fees not attributed to the embedded derivative are excluded from the fair value measurement and classified in policy fees as collected.\nWith respect to embedded policy derivatives in our equity-indexed annuity and life contracts, option pricing models are used to estimate fair value, taking into account assumptions for future equity index growth rates, volatility of the equity index, future interest rates, and determinations on adjusting the participation rate and the cap on equity-indexed credited rates in light of market conditions and policyholder behavior assumptions. These methodologies incorporate an explicit risk margin to take into consideration market participant estimates of projected cash flows and policyholder behavior.\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWe also incorporate our own risk of non-performance in the valuation of the embedded policy derivatives associated with variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity and life contracts. Expected cash flows are discounted using the interest rate swap curve (swap curve), which is commonly viewed as being consistent with the credit spreads for highly-rated financial institutions (S&P AA-rated or above). A swap curve shows the fixed-rate leg of a non-complex swap against the floating rate (for example, LIBOR) leg of a related tenor. The non-performance risk adjustment reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread to the swap curve used to value embedded policy derivatives.\nSuper Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio\nWe value CDS transactions written on the super senior risk layers of designated pools of debt securities or loans using internal valuation models, third-party price estimates and market indices. The principal market was determined to be the market in which super senior CDSs of this type and size would be transacted, or have been transacted, with the greatest volume or level of activity. We have determined that the principal market participants, therefore, would consist of other large financial institutions who participate in sophisticated over-the-counter derivatives markets. The specific valuation methodologies vary based on the nature of the referenced obligations and availability of market prices.\nThe valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance markets. These market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes. Further, disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile markets have increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates of their fair values.\nOur valuation methodologies for the super senior CDS portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information. We have sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis.\nMulti-sector CDO portfolios: We use a modified version of the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model to value our CDS portfolio written on super senior tranches of multi-sector CDOs of ABS. The BET model was developed in 1996 by a major rating agency to generate expected loss estimates for CDO tranches and derive a credit rating for those tranches, and remains widely used.\nWe have adapted the BET model to estimate the price of the super senior risk layer or tranche of the CDO. We modified the BET model to imply default probabilities from market prices for the underlying securities and not from rating agency assumptions. To generate the estimate, the model uses the price estimates for the securities comprising the portfolio of a CDO as an input and converts those estimates to credit spreads over current LIBOR-based interest rates. These credit spreads are used to determine implied probabilities of default and expected losses on the underlying securities. This data is then aggregated and used to estimate the expected cash flows of the super senior tranche of the CDO.\nPrices for the individual securities held by a CDO are obtained in most cases from the CDO collateral managers, to the extent available. CDO collateral managers provided market prices for 49 percent and 46 percent of the underlying securities used in the valuation at December 31, 2014 and 2013. When a price for an individual security is not provided by a CDO collateral manager, we derive the price through a pricing matrix using prices from CDO collateral managers for similar securities. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the relationship of the security to other benchmark quoted securities. Substantially all of the CDO collateral managers who provided prices used dealer prices for all or part of the underlying securities, in some cases supplemented by independent third-party valuation service providers.\nThe BET model also uses diversity scores, weighted average lives, recovery rates and discount rates. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation to assist in quantifying the effect on the valuation of the CDO of the unique aspects of the CDO’s structure such as triggers that divert cash flows to the most senior part of the capital structure. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine whether an underlying security defaults in a given simulation scenario and, if it does, the security’s implied random default time and expected loss. This information is used to project cash flow streams and to determine the expected losses of the portfolio.\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nIn addition to calculating an estimate of the fair value of the super senior CDO security referenced in the CDSs using our internal model, we also consider the price estimates for the super senior CDO securities provided by third parties, including counterparties to these transactions, to validate the results of the model and to determine the best available estimate of fair value. In determining the fair value of the super senior CDO security referenced in the CDSs, we use a consistent process that considers all available pricing data points and eliminates the use of outlying data points. When pricing data points are within a reasonable range an averaging technique is applied.\nCorporate debt/Collateralized loan obligation (CLO) portfolios: For CDSs written on portfolios of investment-grade corporate debt, we use a mathematical model that produces results that are closely aligned with prices received from third parties. This methodology uses the current market credit spreads of the names in the portfolios along with the base correlations implied by the current market prices of comparable tranches of the relevant market traded credit indices as inputs.\nWe estimate the fair value of our obligations resulting from CDSs written on CLOs to be equivalent to the par value less the current market value of the referenced obligation. Accordingly, the value is determined by obtaining third-party quotations on the underlying super senior tranches referenced under the CDS contract.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe fair value of non-structured liabilities is generally determined by using market prices from exchange or dealer markets, when available, or discounting expected cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. We determine the fair value of structured liabilities and hybrid financial instruments (where performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or currency risks) using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described above) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. In addition, adjustments are made to the valuations of both non-structured and structured liabilities to reflect our own creditworthiness based on the methodology described under the caption “Incorporation of Credit Risk in Fair Value Measurements - Our Own Credit Risk” above.\nBorrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), which are guaranteed by us, are recorded at fair value using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts and our current market observable implicit credit spread rates with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. Obligations may be called at various times prior to maturity at the option of the counterparty. Interest rates on these borrowings are primarily fixed, vary by maturity and range up to 8.5 percent.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities measured at fair value include certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase and certain securities sold but not yet purchased. Liabilities arising from securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally treated as collateralized borrowings. We estimate the fair value of liabilities arising under these agreements by using market-observable interest rates. This methodology considers such factors as the coupon rate, yield curves and other relevant factors. Fair values for securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table presents information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level of the fair value measurement based on the observability of the inputs used:\nDecember 31, 2014\nCounterparty\nCash\n(in millions)\nLevel\nLevel\nLevel\nNetting(a)\nCollateral\nTotal\nAssets:\nBonds available for sale:\nU.S. government and government sponsored entities\n$\n$\n2,670\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n2,992\nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n-\n25,500\n2,159\n-\n-\n27,659\nNon-U.S. governments\n20,323\n-\n-\n21,095\nCorporate debt\n-\n142,550\n1,883\n-\n-\n144,433\nRMBS\n-\n20,715\n16,805\n-\n-\n37,520\nCMBS\n-\n10,189\n2,696\n-\n-\n12,885\nCDO/ABS\n-\n7,165\n6,110\n-\n-\n13,275\nTotal bonds available for sale\n1,064\n229,112\n29,683\n-\n-\n259,859\nOther bond securities:\nU.S. government and government sponsored entities\n5,368\n-\n-\n-\n5,498\nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNon-U.S. governments\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCorporate debt\n-\n-\n-\n-\nRMBS\n-\n1,105\n-\n-\n2,094\nCMBS\n-\n-\n-\n1,077\nCDO/ABS\n-\n2,751\n7,449\n-\n-\n10,200\nTotal other bond securities\n10,659\n8,923\n-\n-\n19,712\nEquity securities available for sale:\nCommon stock\n3,626\n-\n-\n3,629\nPreferred stock\n-\n-\n-\n-\nMutual funds\n-\n-\n-\nTotal equity securities available for sale\n4,389\n-\n-\n4,395\nOther equity securities\n1,024\n-\n-\n-\n1,049\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther invested assets\n3,742\n5,650\n-\n-\n9,394\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate contracts (b)\n3,729\n-\n-\n3,743\nForeign exchange contracts(b)\n-\n-\n-\nEquity contracts\n-\n-\nCommodity contracts\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCredit contracts\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther contracts\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCounterparty netting and cash collateral\n-\n-\n-\n(2,102)\n(1,119)\n(3,221)\nTotal derivative assets\n4,626\n(2,102)\n(1,119)\n1,604\nShort-term investments\n1,100\n-\n-\n-\n1,684\nSeparate account assets\n73,939\n6,097\n-\n-\n-\n80,036\nOther assets\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n81,232\n$\n255,366\n$\n44,362\n$\n(2,102)\n$\n(1,119)\n$\n377,739\nLiabilities:\nPolicyholder contract deposits\n$\n-\n$\n$\n1,509\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n1,561\nOther policyholder funds\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate contracts\n-\n3,047\n-\n-\n3,133\nForeign exchange contracts\n-\n1,482\n-\n-\n1,491\nEquity contracts\n-\n-\n-\nCommodity contracts\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCredit contracts\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther contracts\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCounterparty netting and cash collateral\n-\n-\n-\n(2,102)\n(1,429)\n(3,531)\nTotal derivative liabilities\n-\n4,633\n1,171\n(2,102)\n(1,429)\n2,273\nLong-term debt\n-\n5,253\n-\n-\n5,466\nOther liabilities\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n$\n10,262\n$\n2,893\n$\n(2,102)\n$\n(1,429)\n$\n9,658\nItem 8 / note 5.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nTransfers of Level 1 and Level 2 Assets and Liabilities\nOur policy is to record transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 at their fair values as of the end of each reporting period, consistent with the date of the determination of fair value. Assets are transferred out of Level 1 when they are no longer transacted with sufficient frequency and volume in an active market. Conversely, assets are transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 when transaction volume and frequency are indicative of an active market. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we transferred $590 million and $944 million, respectively, of securities issued by Non-U.S. government entities from Level 1 to Level 2, because they are no longer considered actively traded. For similar reasons, during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we transferred $107 million and $356 million, respectively, of securities issued by the U.S. government and government-sponsored entities from Level 1 to Level 2. There were no material transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nChanges in Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present changes during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 in Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and the realized and unrealized gains (losses) related to the Level 3 assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nNet\nChanges in\nRealized and\nUnrealized Gains\nUnrealized\nPurchases,\n(Losses) Included\nFair Value\nGains (Losses)\nOther\nSales,\nGross\nGross\nFair Value\nin Income on\nBeginning\nIncluded\nComprehensive\nIssues and\nTransfers\nTransfers\nEnd\nInstruments Held\n(in millions)\nof Year\nin Income\nIncome (Loss)\nSettlements, Net\nIn\nOut\nof Year\nat End of Year\nDecember 31, 2014\nAssets:\nBonds available for sale:\nObligations of states, municipalities\nand political subdivisions\n$\n1,080\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(187)\n$\n2,159\n$\n-\nNon-U.S. governments\n(1)\n(3)\n-\nCorporate debt\n1,255\n(257)\n1,363\n(509)\n1,883\n-\nRMBS\n14,941\n1,012\n(117)\n16,805\n-\nCMBS\n5,735\n(3,519)\n2,696\n-\nCDO/ABS\n6,974\n(38)\n1,545\n2,488\n(4,945)\n6,110\n-\nTotal bonds available for sale\n30,001\n1,180\n3,092\n4,181\n(9,280)\n29,683\n-\nOther bond securities:\nRMBS\n-\n(20)\n1,105\n(13)\nCMBS\n(6)\n-\n(141)\n(452)\n(7)\nCDO/ABS\n8,834\n1,098\n-\n(1,805)\n(949)\n7,449\nTotal other bond securities\n10,615\n1,132\n-\n(1,849)\n(1,421)\n8,923\nEquity securities available for sale:\nCommon stock\n-\n-\n(1)\n(1)\n-\nPreferred stock\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nMutual funds\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(1)\n-\n-\nTotal equity securities available for sale\n-\n-\n(1)\n(2)\n-\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther invested assets\n5,930\n(83)\n(912)\n5,650\n-\nTotal\n$\n46,547\n$\n2,462\n$\n$\n1,165\n$\n4,797\n$\n(11,615)\n$\n44,263\n$\nLiabilities:\nPolicyholder contract deposits\n$\n(312)\n$\n(1,127)\n$\n(54)\n$\n(16)\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n(1,509)\n$\n(218)\nDerivative liabilities, net:\nInterest rate contracts\n(100)\n(10)\n-\n-\n(3)\n(74)\n(10)\nForeign exchange contracts\n-\n-\n(10)\n-\n-\n(8)\nEquity contracts\n-\n(18)\n(53)\nCommodity contracts\n(1)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(1)\nCredit contracts\n(1,280)\n-\n-\n-\n(978)\nOther contracts\n(109)\n(103)\n-\n(59)\nTotal derivative liabilities, net*\n(1,439)\n(53)\n(56)\n(1,072)\nLong-term debt\n(370)\n-\n(70)\n(213)\nTotal\n$\n(2,121)\n$\n(659)\n$\n(1)\n$\n(32)\n$\n(21)\n$\n$\n(2,794)\n$\nItem 8 / note 5.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n(a) There were no issuances during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n(b) Includes GIAs, notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable.\nBoth observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair values of positions classified in Level 3 in the tables above. As a result, the unrealized gains (losses) on instruments held at December 31, 2014 and 2013 may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in unobservable long-dated volatilities) inputs.\nTransfers of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities\nWe record transfers of assets and liabilities into or out of Level 3 at their fair values as of the end of each reporting period, consistent with the date of the determination of fair value. As a result, the Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in income or other comprehensive income and as shown in the table above excludes $22 million of net gains and $15 million of net losses related to assets and liabilities transferred into Level 3 during 2014 and 2013, respectively, and includes $62 million and $44 million of net gains related to assets and liabilities transferred out of Level 3 during 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTransfers of Level 3 Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, transfers into Level 3 assets primarily included certain investments in private placement corporate debt, RMBS, CMBS, CDO/ABS, and investments in hedge funds. Transfers of private placement corporate debt and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were primarily the result of limited market pricing information that required us to determine fair value for these securities based on inputs that are adjusted to better reflect our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or associated market liquidity. The transfers of investments in RMBS, CMBS and CDO and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were due to decreases in market transparency and liquidity for individual security types. Certain investments in hedge funds were transferred into Level 3 due to these investments now being carried at fair value and no longer being accounted for using the equity method of accounting due to a change in percentage ownership, or as a result of limited market activity due to fund-imposed redemption restrictions.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, transfers out of Level 3 assets primarily included CMBS, CDO/ABS, RMBS, certain investments in municipal securities, private placement and other corporate debt, and investments in hedge funds. Transfers of certain investments in municipal securities, corporate debt, RMBS, CMBS and CDO/ABS out of Level 3 assets were based on consideration of market liquidity as well as related transparency of pricing and associated observable inputs for these investments. Transfers of certain investments in private placement corporate debt and certain ABS out of Level 3 assets were primarily the result of using observable pricing information that reflects the fair value of those securities without the need for adjustment based on our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or the\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\ncurrent liquidity in the market. The transfers of certain hedge fund investments out of Level 3 assets were primarily the result of easing of certain fund-imposed redemption restrictions.\nTransfers of Level 3 Liabilities\nThere were no significant transfers of derivative or other liabilities into or out of Level 3 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nQuantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\nThe table below presents information about the significant unobservable inputs used for recurring fair value measurements for certain Level 3 instruments, and includes only those instruments for which information about the inputs is reasonably available to us, such as data from independent third-party valuation service providers and from internal valuation models. Because input information from third-parties with respect to certain Level 3 instruments (primarily CDO/ABS) may not be reasonably available to us, balances shown below may not equal total amounts reported for such Level 3 assets and liabilities:\nFair Value at\nDecember 31,\nValuation\nRange\n(in millions)\nTechnique\nUnobservable Input(a)\n(Weighted Average )(a)\nAssets:\nObligations of states,\n$\n1,178\nDiscounted cash flow\nYield(b)\n3.9% - 4.62% (4.26%)\nmunicipalities and\npolitical subdivisions\nCorporate debt\n1,145\nDiscounted cash flow\nYield(b)\n3.46% - 8.75% (6.10%)\nRMBS\n17,353\nDiscounted cash flow\nConstant prepayment rate(c)\n0.59% - 9.35% (4.97%)\nLoss severity(c)\n46.04% - 79.56% (62.80%)\nConstant default rate(c)\n3.67% - 9.96% (6.82%)\nYield(c)\n2.67% - 6.64% (4.65%)\nCertain CDO/ABS\n5,282\nDiscounted cash flow\nConstant prepayment rate(c)\n6.40% - 12.80% (9.20%)\nLoss severity(c)\n42.90% - 60.30% (51.90%)\nConstant default rate(c)\n2.50% - 14.70% (7.80%)\nYield(c)\n4.70% - 9.70% (7.10%)\nCMBS\n2,687\nDiscounted cash flow\nYield(b)\n0.00% - 17.29% (6.06%)\nCDO/ABS - Direct\nBinomial Expansion\nRecovery rate(b)\n7.00% - 36.00% (21.00%)\nInvestment Book\nTechnique (BET)\nDiversity score(b)\n- 27 (12)\nWeighted average life(b)\n0.25 - 10.49 years (3.93 years)\nLiabilities:\nPolicyholder contract\ndeposits\n1,509\nDiscounted cash flow\nEquity implied volatility(b)\n6.00% - 39.00%\nBase lapse rate(b)\n1.00% - 40.00%\nDynamic lapse rate(b)\n0.20% - 60.00%\nMortality rate(b)\n0.10% - 35.00%\nUtilization rate(b)\n0.50% - 30.00%\nTotal derivative\nliabilities, net\nBET\nRecovery rate(b)\n5.00% - 23.00% (13.00%)\nDiversity score(b)\n- 25 (13)\nWeighted average life(b)\n2.67 - 10.49 years (4.65 years)\nItem 8 / note 5.

The ranges of these inputs do not directly correlate to changes in the fair values of the tranches purchased by us because there are other factors relevant to the fair values of specific tranches owned by us including, but not limited to, purchase price, position in the waterfall, senior versus subordinated position and attachment points.\n(b) Represents discount rates, estimates and assumptions that we believe would be used by market participants when valuing these assets and liabilities.\n(c) Information received from third-party valuation service providers.\nThe ranges of reported inputs for Corporate debt, RMBS, CDO/ABS, and CMBS valued using a discounted cash flow technique consist of plus/minus one standard deviation in either direction from the value-weighted average. The preceding table does not give effect to our risk management practices that might offset risks inherent in these investments.\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nSensitivity to Changes in Unobservable Inputs\nWe consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available to us about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Relevant inputs vary depending on the nature of the instrument being measured at fair value. The following is a general description of sensitivities of significant unobservable inputs along with interrelationships between and among the significant unobservable inputs and their impact on the fair value measurements. The effect of a change in a particular assumption in the sensitivity analysis below is considered independently of changes in any other assumptions. In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions may not always have a linear effect on the inputs discussed below. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. Such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. For each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.\nCorporate Debt\nCorporate debt securities included in Level 3 are primarily private placement issuances that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions. Fair value measurements consider illiquidity and non-transferability. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models using discount rates based on credit spreads, yields or price levels of publicly-traded debt of the issuer or other comparable securities, considering illiquidity and structure. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of corporate debt is the yield. The yield is affected by the market movements in credit spreads and U.S. Treasury yields. In addition, the migration in credit quality of a given security generally has a corresponding effect on the fair value measurement of the security. For example, a downward migration of credit quality would increase spreads. Holding U.S. Treasury rates constant, an increase in corporate credit spreads would decrease the fair value of corporate debt.\nRMBS and Certain CDO/ABS\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements of RMBS and certain CDO/ABS valued by third-party valuation service providers are constant prepayment rates (CPR), loss severity, constant default rates (CDR), and yield. A change in the assumptions used for the probability of default will generally be accompanied by a corresponding change in the assumption used for the loss severity and an inverse change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. In general, increases in CPR, loss severity, CDR, and yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the directional change of each input is not usually linear.\nCMBS\nThe significant unobservable input used in fair value measurements for CMBS is the yield. Prepayment assumptions for each mortgage pool are factored into the yield. CMBS generally feature a lower degree of prepayment risk than RMBS because commercial mortgages generally contain a penalty for prepayment. In general, increases in the yield would decrease the fair value of CMBS.\nCDO/ABS - Direct Investment book\nThe significant unobservable inputs used for certain CDO/ABS securities valued using the BET are recovery rates, diversity score, and the weighted average life of the portfolio. An increase in recovery rates and diversity score will increase the fair value of the portfolio. An increase in the weighted average life will decrease the fair value.\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nPolicyholder contract deposits\nEmbedded derivatives within Policyholder contract deposits relate to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) within variable annuity products and certain enhancements to interest crediting rates based on market indices within index annuities and guaranteed investment contracts (GICs). GMWB represents our largest exposure of these embedded derivatives, although the carrying amount of the liability fluctuates based on the performance of the equity markets and therefore, at a point in time, can be low relative to the exposure. The principal unobservable input used for GMWBs and embedded derivatives in index annuities measured at fair value is equity implied volatility. For GMWBs, other significant unobservable inputs include base and dynamic lapse rates, mortality rates, and utilization rates. Lapse, mortality, and utilization rates may vary significantly depending upon age groups and duration. In general, increases in volatility and utilization rates will increase the fair value of the liability associated with GMWB, while increases in lapse rates and mortality rates will decrease the fair value of the liability. Significant unobservable inputs used in valuing embedded derivatives within GICs include long-term forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Generally, the embedded derivative liability for GICs will increase as interest rates decrease or if the U.S. dollar weakens compared to the euro.\nDerivative liabilities - credit contracts\nThe significant unobservable inputs used for Derivatives liabilities - credit contracts are recovery rates, diversity scores, and the weighted average life of the portfolio. AIG non-performance risk is also considered in the measurement of the liability.\nAn increase in recovery rates and diversity score will decrease the fair value of the liability. An increase in the weighted average life will increase the fair value measurement of the liability.\nInvestments in Certain Entities Carried at Fair Value Using Net Asset Value per Share\nThe following table includes information related to our investments in certain other invested assets, including private equity funds, hedge funds and other alternative investments that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). For these investments, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we use the net asset value per share as a practical expedient to measure fair value.\nDecember 31, 2014\nDecember 31, 2013\nFair Value Using Net Asset Value Per Share (or its equivalent)\nFair Value Using Net Asset Value Per Share (or its equivalent)\nUnfunded\nUnfunded\n(in millions)\nInvestment Category Includes\nCommitments\nCommitments\nInvestment Category\nPrivate equity funds:\nLeveraged buyout\nDebt and/or equity investments made as part of a transaction in which assets of mature companies are acquired from the current shareholders, typically with the use of financial leverage\n$\n2,275\n$\n$\n2,544\n$\nReal Estate /\nInfrastructure\nInvestments in real estate properties and infrastructure positions, including power plants and other energy generating facilities\nVenture capital\nEarly-stage, high-potential, growth companies expected to generate a return through an eventual realization event, such as an initial public offering or sale of the company\nDistressed\nSecurities of companies that are in default, under bankruptcy protection, or troubled\nOther\nIncludes multi-strategy, mezzanine, and other strategies\nTotal private equity funds\n3,160\n3,347\nHedge funds:\nEvent-driven\nSecurities of companies undergoing material structural changes, including mergers, acquisitions and other reorganizations\n1,109\n-\nLong-short\nSecurities that the manager believes are undervalued, with corresponding short positions to hedge market risk\n2,428\n1,759\nMacro\nInvestments that take long and short positions in financial instruments based on a top-down view of certain economic and capital market conditions\n-\n-\nDistressed\nSecurities of companies that are in default, under bankruptcy protection or troubled\nEmerging markets\nInvestments in the financial markets of developing countries\n-\n-\nOther\nIncludes multi-strategy, relative value, and other strategies\n-\n-\nTotal hedge funds\n5,199\n4,385\nTotal\n$\n8,359\n$\n$\n7,732\n$\nItem 8 / note 5.

Private equity funds are generally expected to have 10-year lives at their inception, but these lives may be extended at the fund manager’s discretion, typically in one or two-year increments. At December 31, 2014, assuming average original expected lives of 10 years for the funds, 72 percent of the total fair value using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) presented above would have expected remaining lives of three years or less, 18 percent between four and six years and 10 percent between seven and 10 years.\nThe hedge fund investments included above are generally redeemable monthly (14 percent), quarterly (49 percent), semi-annually (15 percent) and annually (22 percent), with redemption notices ranging from one day to 180 days. At December 31, 2014, however, investments representing approximately 43 percent of the total fair value of the hedge fund investments cannot be redeemed, either in whole or in part, because the investments include various contractual restrictions. The majority of these contractual restrictions, which may have been put in place at the fund’s inception or thereafter, have pre-defined end dates and are generally expected to be lifted by the end of 2015. The fund investments for which redemption is restricted only in part generally relate to certain hedge funds that hold at least one investment that the fund manager deems to be illiquid.\nFair Value Option\nUnder the fair value option, we may elect to measure at fair value financial assets and financial liabilities that are not otherwise required to be carried at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value for designated items are reported in earnings. We elect the fair value option for certain hybrid securities given the complexity of bifurcating the economic components associated with the embedded derivatives. Refer to Note 11 for additional information related to embedded derivatives.\nAdditionally, beginning in the third quarter of 2012 we elected the fair value option for certain alternative investments when such investments are eligible for this election. We believe this measurement basis is consistent with the applicable accounting guidance used by the respective investment company funds themselves. Refer to Note 6 herein for additional information.\nThe following table presents the gains or losses recorded related to the eligible instruments for which we elected the fair value option:\nYears Ended December 31,\nGain (Loss)\n(in millions)\nAssets:\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n$\n-\n$\n$\nBond and equity securities\n2,099\n1,667\n2,339\nOther securities - ML II interest\n-\n-\nOther securities - ML III interest\n-\n-\n2,888\nRetained interest in AIA\n-\n-\n2,069\nAlternative investments(a)\nOther, including Short-term investments\nLiabilities:\nLong-term debt(b)\n(269)\n(681)\nOther liabilities\n(13)\n(15)\n(33)\nTotal gain\n$\n2,140\n$\n2,353\n$\n6,931\nItem 8 / note 5.

Interest expense on liabilities measured under the fair value option is reported in Other Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 herein for additional information about our policies for recognition, measurement, and disclosure of interest and dividend income and interest expense.\nDuring 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized losses of $32 million, $54 million and $641 million, respectively, attributable to the observable effect of changes in credit spreads on our own liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. We calculate the effect of these credit spread changes using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate current market interest rates, our observable credit spreads on these liabilities and other factors that mitigate the risk of nonperformance such as cash collateral posted.\nThe following table presents the difference between fair values and the aggregate contractual principal amounts of mortgage and other loans receivable and long-term borrowings for which the fair value option was elected:\nDecember 31, 2014\nDecember 31, 2013\nOutstanding\nOutstanding\n(in millions)\nFair Value\nPrincipal Amount\nDifference\nFair Value\nPrincipal Amount\nDifference\nAssets:\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nLiabilities:\nLong-term debt*\n$\n5,466\n$\n4,101\n$\n1,365\n$\n6,747\n$\n5,231\n$\n1,516\n* Includes GIAs, notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable.\nThere were no mortgage or other loans receivable for which the fair value option was elected that were 90 days or more past due or in non-accrual status at December 31, 2014 or 2013.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS\nWe measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally quarterly, annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. These assets include cost and equity-method investments, investments in life settlements, collateral securing foreclosed loans and real estate and other fixed assets, goodwill and other intangible assets. See Note 6 herein for additional information about how we test various asset classes for impairment.\nThe following table presents assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at the time of impairment and the related impairment charges recorded during the periods presented:\nAssets at Fair Value\nImpairment Charges\nNon-Recurring Basis\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nLevel\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2014\nOther investments\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nInvestments in life settlements\n-\n-\nOther assets\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n1,328\n$\n1,328\n$\n$\n1,114\n$\nDecember 31, 2013\nOther investments\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n1,615\n$\n1,615\nInvestments in life settlements\n-\n-\nOther assets\n-\nTotal\n$\n-\n$\n$\n2,559\n$\n2,570\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFAIR VALUE INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\nInformation regarding the estimation of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value (excluding insurance contracts and lease contracts) is discussed below:\n• Mortgage and other loans receivable: Fair values of loans on real estate and other loans receivable are estimated for disclosure purposes using discounted cash flow calculations based on discount rates that we believe market participants would use in determining the price that they would pay for such assets. For certain loans, our current incremental lending rates for similar types of loans are used as the discount rates, because we believe this rate approximates the rates market participants would use. The fair values of policy loans are generally estimated based on unpaid principal amount as of each reporting date or, in some cases, based on the present value of the loans using a discounted cash flow model. No consideration is given to credit risk because policy loans are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policies.\n• Other invested assets: The majority of Other invested assets that are not measured at fair value represent investments in life settlements. The fair value of investments in life settlements is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology that incorporates the best available market assumptions for longevity as well as market yields based on reported transactions. Due to the individual life nature of each investment in life settlements and the illiquidity of the existing market, significant inputs to the fair value are unobservable.\n• Cash and short-term investments: The carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk.\n• Policyholder contract deposits associated with investment-type contracts: Fair values for policyholder contract deposits associated with investment-type contracts not accounted for at fair value are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those of the contracts being valued. When no similar contracts are being offered, the discount rate is the appropriate swap rate (if available) or current risk-free interest rate consistent with the currency in which the cash flows are denominated. To determine fair value, other factors include current policyholder account values and related surrender charges and other assumptions include expectations about policyholder behavior and an appropriate risk margin.\n• Other liabilities: The majority of Other liabilities that are financial instruments not measured at fair value represent secured financing arrangements, including repurchase agreements. The carrying amounts of these liabilities approximate fair value, because the financing arrangements are short-term and are secured by cash or other liquid collateral.\n• Long-term debt: Fair values of these obligations were determined by reference to quoted market prices, when available and appropriate, or discounted cash flow calculations based upon our current market-observable implicit-credit-spread rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued.\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments not measured at fair value and indicates the level in the fair value hierarchy of the estimated fair value measurement based on the observability of the inputs used:\nEstimated Fair Value\nCarrying\n(in millions)\nLevel\nLevel\nLevel\nTotal\nValue\nDecember 31, 2014\nAssets:\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n$\n-\n$\n$\n26,157\n$\n26,606\n$\n24,984\nOther invested assets\n-\n2,882\n3,475\n4,352\nShort-term investments\n-\n9,559\n-\n9,559\n9,559\nCash\n1,758\n-\n-\n1,758\n1,758\nLiabilities:\nPolicyholder contract deposits associated\nwith investment-type contracts\n-\n119,268\n119,512\n106,395\nOther liabilities\n-\n1,120\n-\n1,120\n1,120\nLong-term debt\n-\n24,749\n2,932\n27,681\n25,751\nDecember 31, 2013\nAssets:\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n$\n-\n$\n$\n21,418\n$\n21,637\n$\n20,765\nOther invested assets\n-\n2,705\n3,234\n4,194\nShort-term investments\n-\n15,304\n-\n15,304\n15,304\nCash\n2,241\n-\n-\n2,241\n2,241\nLiabilities:\nPolicyholder contract deposits associated\nwith investment-type contracts\n-\n114,361\n114,560\n105,093\nOther liabilities\n-\n4,869\n4,870\n4,869\nLong-term debt\n-\n36,239\n2,394\n38,633\n34,946\nItem 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n6. INVESTMENTS\nFixed Maturity and Equity Securities\nBonds held to maturity are carried at amortized cost when we have the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. When we do not have the ability or positive intent to hold bonds until maturity, these securities are classified as available for sale or are measured at fair value at our election. None of our fixed maturity securities met the criteria for held to maturity classification at December 31, 2014 or 2013.\nFixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses from available for sale investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes, in shareholders’ equity. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from fixed maturity and equity securities measured at fair value at our election are reflected in Net investment income (for insurance subsidiaries) or Other income (for Corporate and Other). Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are recorded on a trade-date basis.\nPremiums and discounts arising from the purchase of bonds classified as available for sale are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated holding periods, until maturity, or call date, if applicable. For investments in certain RMBS, CMBS and CDO/ABS, (collectively, structured securities), recognized yields are updated based on current information regarding the timing and amount of expected undiscounted future cash flows. For high credit quality structured securities, effective yields are recalculated based on actual payments received and updated prepayment expectations, and the amortized cost is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since acquisition with a corresponding charge or credit to net investment income. For structured securities that are not high credit quality, effective yields are recalculated and adjusted prospectively based on changes in expected undiscounted future cash flows. For purchased credit impaired (PCI) securities, at acquisition, the difference between the undiscounted expected future cash flows and the recorded investment in the securities represents the initial accretable yield, which is to be accreted into net investment income over the securities’ remaining lives on a level-yield basis. Subsequently, effective yields recognized on PCI securities are recalculated and adjusted prospectively to reflect changes in the contractual benchmark interest rates on variable rate securities and any significant increases in undiscounted expected future cash flows arising due to reasons other than interest rate changes.\nSecurities Available for Sale\nThe following table presents the amortized cost or cost and fair value of our available for sale securities:\nOther-Than-\nAmortized\nGross\nGross\nTemporary\nCost or\nUnrealized\nUnrealized\nFair\nImpairments\n(in millions)\nCost\nGains\nLosses\nValue\nin AOCI(a)\nDecember 31, 2014\nBonds available for sale:\nU.S. government and government sponsored entities\n$\n2,806\n$\n$\n(18)\n$\n2,992\n$\n-\nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n25,979\n1,729\n(49)\n27,659\n(13)\nNon-U.S. governments\n20,280\n(151)\n21,095\n-\nCorporate debt\n134,961\n10,594\n(1,122)\n144,433\nMortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:\nRMBS\n34,377\n3,435\n(292)\n37,520\n1,767\nCMBS\n12,129\n(59)\n12,885\nCDO/ABS\n12,775\n(128)\n13,275\nTotal mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized\n59,281\n4,878\n(479)\n63,680\n2,029\nTotal bonds available for sale(b)\n243,307\n18,371\n(1,819)\n259,859\n2,080\nEquity securities available for sale:\nCommon stock\n1,185\n2,461\n(17)\n3,629\n-\nPreferred stock\n-\n-\nMutual funds\n(37)\n-\nTotal equity securities available for sale\n1,930\n2,519\n(54)\n4,395\n-\nTotal\n$\n245,237\n$\n20,890\n$\n(1,873)\n$\n264,254\n$\n2,080\nDecember 31, 2013\nBonds available for sale:\nU.S. government and government sponsored entities\n$\n3,084\n$\n$\n(39)\n$\n3,195\n$\n-\nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n28,704\n1,122\n(446)\n29,380\n(15)\nNon-U.S. governments\n22,045\n(358)\n22,509\n-\nCorporate debt\n139,461\n7,989\n(2,898)\n144,552\nMortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:\nRMBS\n33,520\n3,101\n(473)\n36,148\n1,670\nCMBS\n11,216\n(292)\n11,482\nCDO/ABS\n10,501\n(142)\n11,008\nTotal mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized\n55,237\n4,308\n(907)\n58,638\n1,857\nTotal bonds available for sale(b)\n248,531\n14,391\n(4,648)\n258,274\n1,916\nEquity securities available for sale:\nCommon stock\n1,280\n1,953\n(14)\n3,219\n-\nPreferred stock\n(1)\n-\nMutual funds\n(24)\n-\nTotal equity securities available for sale\n1,726\n1,969\n(39)\n3,656\n-\nTotal\n$\n250,257\n$\n16,360\n$\n(4,687)\n$\n261,930\n$\n1,916\nItem 8 / note 5.

We did not recognize the unrealized losses in earnings on these fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2014, because we neither intend to sell the securities nor do we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. For fixed maturity securities with significant declines, we performed fundamental credit analysis on a security-by-security basis, which included consideration of credit enhancements, expected defaults on underlying collateral, review of relevant industry analyst reports and forecasts and other available market data.\nContractual Maturities of Fixed Maturity Securities Available for Sale\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities available for sale by contractual maturity:\nTotal Fixed Maturity Securities\nFixed Maturity Securities Available\nDecember 31, 2014\nAvailable for Sale\nfor Sale in a Loss Position\n(in millions)\nAmortized Cost\nFair Value\nAmortized Cost\nFair Value\nDue in one year or less\n$\n9,821\n$\n9,975\n$\n$\nDue after one year through five years\n48,352\n50,873\n6,669\n6,529\nDue after five years through ten years\n62,685\n65,889\n12,873\n12,338\nDue after ten years\n63,168\n69,442\n10,255\n9,607\nMortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized\n59,281\n63,680\n17,120\n16,641\nTotal\n$\n243,307\n$\n259,859\n$\n47,554\n$\n45,735\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nItem 8 / note 6.

INVESTMENTS\nOther Invested Assets Carried at Fair Value\nCertain hedge funds, private equity funds, affordable housing partnerships and other investment partnerships for which we have elected the fair value option are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Net investment income with the exception of investments of AIG’s Corporate and Other category, for which such changes are reported in Other income. Other investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, affordable housing partnerships and other investment partnerships in which our insurance operations do not hold aggregate interests sufficient to exercise more than minor influence over the respective partnerships are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. These investments are subject to other-than-temporary impairment evaluations (see discussion below on evaluating equity investments for other-than-temporary impairment). The gross unrealized loss recorded in Other comprehensive income on such investments was $56 million and $15 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the majority of which pertains to investments in private equity funds and hedge funds that have been in continuous unrealized loss positions for less than 12 months.\nOther Invested Assets - Equity Method Investments\nWe account for hedge funds, private equity funds, affordable housing partnerships and other investment partnerships using the equity method of accounting unless our interest is so minor that we may have virtually no influence over partnership operating and financial policies, or we have elected the fair value option. Under the equity method of accounting, our carrying amount generally is our share of the net asset value of the funds or the partnerships, and changes in our share of the net asset values are recorded in Net investment income with the exception of investments of AIG’s Corporate and Other category, for which such changes are reported in Other income. In applying the equity method of accounting, we consistently use the most recently available financial information provided by the general partner or manager of each of these investments, which is one to three months prior to the end of our reporting period. The financial statements of these investees are generally audited annually.\nSummarized Financial Information of Equity Method Investees\nThe following is the aggregated summarized financial information of our equity method investees, including those for which the fair value option has been elected:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nOperating results:\nTotal revenues\n$\n29,579\n$\n19,181\n$\n9,438\nTotal expenses\n(7,828)\n(5,515)\n(5,183)\nNet income\n$\n21,751\n$\n13,666\n$\n4,255\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\nBalance sheet:\nTotal assets\n$\n207,994\n$\n150,586\nTotal liabilities\n$\n(67,346)\n$\n(25,134)\nThe following table presents the carrying amount and ownership percentage of equity method investments at December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nCarrying\nOwnership\nCarrying\nOwnership\n(in millions, except percentages)\nValue\nPercentage\nValue\nPercentage\nEquity method investments\n$\n18,951\nVarious\n$\n12,921\nVarious\nSummarized financial information for these equity method investees may be presented on a lag, due to the unavailability of information for the investees at our respective balance sheet dates, and is included for the periods in which we held an equity method ownership interest.\nItem 8 / note 6. INVESTMENTS\nOther Investments\nAlso included in Other invested assets are real estate held for investment and aircraft asset investments held by non-Aircraft Leasing subsidiaries. These investments are reported at cost, less depreciation and are subject to impairment review, as discussed below.\nInvestments in Life Settlements\nInvestments in life settlements are accounted for under the investment method. Under the investment method, we recognize our initial investment in life settlements at the transaction price plus all initial direct external costs. Continuing costs to keep the policy in force, primarily life insurance premiums, increase the carrying amount of the investment. We recognize income on individual investments in life settlements when the insured dies, at an amount equal to the excess of the investment proceeds over the carrying amount of the investment at that time. These investments are subject to impairment review, as discussed below.\nDuring 2014, 2013 and 2012, income recognized on investments in life settlements was $407 million, $334 million and $253 million, respectively, and is included in Net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table presents further information regarding investments in life settlements:\nDecember 31, 2014\nNumber of\nCarrying\nFace Value\n(dollars in millions)\nContracts\nValue\n(Death Benefits)\nRemaining Life Expectancy of Insureds:\n0 - 1 year\n$\n-\n$\n-\n1 - 2 years\n2 - 3 years\n3 - 4 years\n4 - 5 years\nThereafter\n4,687\n3,486\n15,370\nTotal\n4,947\n$\n3,753\n$\n15,937\nRemaining life expectancy for year 0-1 references policies whose current life expectancy is less than 12 months as of the valuation date.

INVESTMENTS\nChange in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments\nThe following table presents the increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of our available for sale securities and other investments:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nIncrease (decrease) in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments:\nFixed maturities\n$\n6,809\n$\n(14,066)\nEquity securities\nOther investments\nTotal increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments*\n$\n7,720\n$\n(13,605)\n* Excludes net unrealized gains attributable to businesses held for sale.\nEvaluating Investments for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments\nFixed Maturity Securities\nIf we intend to sell a fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding charge to realized capital losses. When assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our investment portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to take advantage of favorable pricing.\nFor fixed maturity securities for which a credit impairment has occurred, the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recoverable value with a corresponding charge to realized capital losses. The estimated recoverable value is the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, as determined by management. The difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not related to a credit impairment is presented in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fixed maturity securities on which other-than-temporary credit impairments were recognized (a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income).\nWhen estimating future cash flows for structured fixed maturity securities (e.g., RMBS, CMBS, CDO, ABS) management considers historical performance of underlying assets and available market information as well as bond-specific structural considerations, such as credit enhancement and priority of payment structure of the security. In addition, the process of estimating future cash flows includes, but is not limited to, the following critical inputs, which vary by asset class:\n• Current delinquency rates;\n• Expected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n• Loss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n• Expected prepayment speeds.\nFor corporate, municipal and sovereign fixed maturity securities determined to be credit impaired, management considers the fair value as the recoverable value when available information does not indicate that another value is more relevant or reliable. When management identifies information that supports a recoverable value other than the fair value, the determination of a recoverable value considers scenarios specific to the issuer and the security, and may be based upon estimates of outcomes of corporate restructurings, political and macroeconomic factors, stability and financial strength of the issuer, the value of any secondary sources of repayment and the disposition of assets.\nWe consider severe price declines in our assessment of potential credit impairments. We may also modify our model inputs when we determine that price movements in certain sectors are indicative of factors not captured by the cash flow models.\nItem 8 / note 6. INVESTMENTS\nIn periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, we prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining expected holding period of the security.\nCredit Impairments\nThe following table presents a rollforward of the cumulative credit losses in other-than-temporary impairments recognized in earnings for available for sale fixed maturity securities:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n3,872\n$\n5,164\n$\n6,504\nIncreases due to:\nCredit impairments on new securities subject to impairment losses\nAdditional credit impairments on previously impaired securities\nReductions due to:\nCredit impaired securities fully disposed for which there was no\nprior intent or requirement to sell\n(613)\n(643)\n(1,105)\nCredit impaired securities for which there is a current intent or\nanticipated requirement to sell\n-\n-\n(5)\nAccretion on securities previously impaired due to credit*\n(725)\n(774)\n(915)\nOther\n(9)\n-\nBalance, end of year\n$\n2,659\n$\n3,872\n$\n5,164\n* Represents both accretion recognized due to changes in cash flows expected to be collected over the remaining expected term of the credit impaired securities and the accretion due to the passage of time.\nEquity Securities\nWe evaluate our available for sale equity securities for impairment by considering such securities as candidates for other-than-temporary impairment if they meet any of the following criteria:\n• The security has traded at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to cost for an extended period of time (nine consecutive months or longer);\n• A discrete credit event has occurred resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court-supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than the par value of their claims; or\n• We have concluded that we may not realize a full recovery on our investment, regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events.\nThe determination that an equity security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer, its near-term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances. In addition to the above criteria, all equity securities that have been in a continuous decline in value below cost over twelve months are impaired. We also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline (50 percent or more) discount to cost, in which we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary (severity losses).\nOther Invested Assets\nOur equity and cost method investments in private equity funds, hedge funds and other entities are evaluated for impairment similar to the evaluation of equity securities for impairments as discussed above. Such evaluation considers market conditions, events and volatility that may impact the recoverability of the underlying investments within these private equity funds and hedge funds and is based on the nature of the underlying investments and specific inherent risks. Such risks may evolve based on the nature of the underlying investments.\nItem 8 / note 6. INVESTMENTS\nOur investments in life settlements are monitored for impairment on a contract-by-contract basis quarterly. An investment in life settlements is considered impaired if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the expected proceeds from the investment in life settlements would not be sufficient to recover our estimated future carrying amount of the investment in life settlements, which is the current carrying amount for the investment in life settlements plus anticipated undiscounted future premiums and other capitalizable future costs, if any. Impaired investments in life settlements are written down to their estimated fair value which is determined on a discounted cash flow basis, incorporating current market longevity assumptions and market yields.\nIn general, fair value estimates for the investments in life settlements are calculated using cash flows based on medical underwriting ratings of the policies from a third-party underwriter, applied to an industry mortality table. Our mortality assumptions are based on an industry table as supplemented with proprietary data on the older age mortality of U.S. insured lives. Mortality improvement factors are applied to these assumptions based on our view of future mortality improvements likely to apply to the U.S. insured lives population. Our mortality assumptions coupled with the mortality improvement rates are used in our estimate of future net cash flows from the investments in life settlements.\nOur investments in aircraft assets and real estate are periodically evaluated for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired. When impairment indicators are present, we compare expected investment cash flows to carrying amount. When the expected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the investments are written down to fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings.\nPurchased Credit Impaired (PCI) Securities\nWe purchase certain RMBS securities that have experienced deterioration in credit quality since their issuance. We determine, based on our expectations as to the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be received, whether it is probable at acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required payments for these PCI securities, including both principal and interest after considering the effects of prepayments. At acquisition, the timing and amount of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be received on each PCI security is determined based on our best estimate using key assumptions, such as interest rates, default rates and prepayment speeds. At acquisition, the difference between the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the PCI securities and the recorded investment in the securities represents the initial accretable yield, which is accreted into Net investment income over their remaining lives on a level-yield basis. Additionally, the difference between the contractually required payments on the PCI securities and the undiscounted expected future cash flows represents the non-accretable difference at acquisition. The accretable yield and the non-accretable difference will change over time, based on actual payments received and changes in estimates of undiscounted expected future cash flows, which are discussed further below.\nOn a quarterly basis, the undiscounted expected future cash flows associated with PCI securities are re-evaluated based on updates to key assumptions. Declines in undiscounted expected future cash flows due to further credit deterioration as well as changes in the expected timing of the cash flows can result in the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge, as PCI securities are subject to our policy for evaluating investments for other-than-temporary impairment. Changes to undiscounted expected future cash flows due solely to the changes in the contractual benchmark interest rates on variable rate PCI securities will change the accretable yield prospectively. Significant increases in undiscounted expected future cash flows for reasons other than interest rate changes are recognized prospectively as adjustments to the accretable yield.\nThe following tables present information on our PCI securities, which are included in bonds available for sale:\n(in millions)\nAt Date of Acquisition\nContractually required payments (principal and interest)\n$\n30,520\nCash flows expected to be collected*\n24,561\nRecorded investment in acquired securities\n16,311\n* Represents undiscounted expected cash flows, including both principal and interest.\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nOutstanding principal balance\n$\n16,962\n$\n14,741\nAmortized cost\n12,216\n10,110\nFair value\n13,462\n11,338\nItem 8 / note 6.

In the majority of these repurchase agreements, the securities transferred by us may be sold or repledged by the counterparties. Repurchase agreements entered into by the DIB are carried at fair value based on market-observable interest rates. All other repurchase agreements are recorded at their contracted repurchase amounts plus accrued interest.\nAt December 31, 2013, our secured financing transactions also included those that involve the transfer of securities to financial institutions in exchange for cash or other liquid collateral. Securities transferred by us under these financing transactions may be sold or repledged by the counterparties. As collateral for the securities transferred by us, counterparties transfer assets to us, such as cash or high quality fixed maturity securities. Collateral levels are monitored daily and are generally maintained at an agreed-upon percentage of the fair value of the transferred securities during the life of the transactions. When we receive fixed maturity securities as collateral, we do not have the right to sell or repledge this collateral unless an event of default occurs by the counterparties. At the termination of the transactions, we and our counterparties are obligated to return the collateral provided and the securities transferred, respectively.\nThe following table presents the fair value of securities pledged to counterparties under secured financing transactions:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2014\nDecember 31, 2013\nSecurities available for sale\n$\n-\n$\n3,837\nOther securities\n2,122\n2,766\nWe also enter into agreements in which securities are purchased by us under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements), which are accounted for as secured financing transactions and reported as Short-term investments or Other assets, depending on their terms. These agreements are recorded at their contracted resale amounts plus accrued interest, other than those that are accounted for at fair value. Such agreements entered into by the DIB are carried at fair value based on market observable interest rates. In all reverse repurchase transactions, we take possession of or obtain a security interest in the related securities, and we have the right to sell or repledge this collateral received.\nThe following table presents information on the fair value of securities pledged to us under reverse repurchase agreements:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2014\nDecember 31, 2013\nSecurities collateral pledged to us\n$\n2,506\n$\n8,878\nAmount repledged by us\nItem 8 / note 6. INVESTMENTS\nInsurance - Statutory and Other Deposits\nTotal carrying amounts of cash and securities deposited by our insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities or other insurance-related arrangements, including certain annuity-related obligations and certain reinsurance agreements, were $5.9 billion and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOther Pledges\nCertain of our subsidiaries are members of Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and such membership requires the members to own stock in these FHLBs. We owned an aggregate of $44 million and $57 million of stock in FHLBs at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent an AIG subsidiary borrows from the FHLB, its ownership interest in the stock of FHLBs will be pledged to the FHLB. In addition, our subsidiaries have pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $535 million and $80 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, associated with advances from the FHLBs.\nCertain GIAs have provisions that require collateral to be posted or payments to be made by us upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to the counterparties in the event of such downgrades, and the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depend on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade. The fair value of securities pledged as collateral with respect to these obligations approximated $3.5 billion and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.\n7. LENDING ACTIVITIES\nMortgage and other loans receivable include commercial mortgages, life insurance policy loans, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable. Commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances less credit allowances and plus or minus adjustments for the accretion or amortization of discount or premium. Interest income on such loans is accrued as earned.\nDirect costs of originating commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable, net of nonrefundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of the related receivables. The amount deferred is amortized to income as an adjustment to earnings using the interest method.\nLife insurance policy loans are carried at unpaid principal amount. There is no allowance for policy loans because these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy.\nThe following table presents the composition of Mortgages and other loans receivable:\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nCommercial mortgages*\n$\n18,909\n$\n16,195\nLife insurance policy loans\n2,710\n2,830\nCommercial loans, other loans and notes receivable\n3,642\n2,052\nTotal mortgage and other loans receivable\n25,261\n21,077\nAllowance for losses\n(271)\n(312)\nMortgage and other loans receivable, net\n$\n24,990\n$\n20,765\n* Commercial mortgages primarily represent loans for apartments, offices, retail and industrial properties, with exposures in California and New York representing the largest geographic concentrations (14 percent and 18 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2014 and 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2013).\nThe following table presents the credit quality indicators for commercial mortgage loans:\nNumber\nPercent\nDecember 31, 2014\nof\nClass\nof\n(dollars in millions)\nLoans\nApartments\nOffices\nRetail\nIndustrial\nHotel\nOthers\nTotal(c)\nTotal $\nCredit Quality Indicator:\nIn good standing\n1,007\n$\n3,384\n$\n6,100\n$\n3,807\n$\n1,689\n$\n1,660\n$\n1,812\n$\n18,452\n%\nRestructured(a)\n-\n-\n-\n90 days or less delinquent\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n>90 days delinquent or in\nprocess of foreclosure\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal(b)\n1,024\n$\n3,384\n$\n6,518\n$\n3,824\n$\n1,689\n$\n1,677\n$\n1,817\n$\n18,909\n%\nAllowance for losses\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n%\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions)\nCredit Quality Indicator:\nIn good standing\n$\n2,786\n$\n4,636\n$\n3,364\n$\n1,607\n$\n1,431\n$\n1,970\n$\n15,794\n%\nRestructured(a)\n-\n-\n90 days or less delinquent\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n>90 days delinquent or in\nprocess of foreclosure\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal(b)\n$\n2,839\n$\n4,888\n$\n3,375\n$\n1,607\n$\n1,431\n$\n2,055\n$\n16,195\n%\nAllowance for losses\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n%\nItem 8 / note 6.

See discussion of troubled debt restructurings below.\n(b) Does not reflect allowance for losses.\n(c) Over 99 percent of the commercial mortgages held at such respective dates were current as to payments of principal and interest.\nMethodology Used to Estimate the Allowance for Losses\nMortgage and other loans receivable are considered impaired when collection of all amounts due under contractual terms is not probable. Impairment is measured using either i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, ii) the loan’s observable market price, if available, or iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Impairment of commercial mortgages is typically determined using the fair value of collateral while impairment of other loans is typically determined using the present value of cash flows or the loan’s observable market price. An allowance is typically established for the difference between the impaired value of the loan and its current carrying amount. Additional allowance amounts are established for incurred but not specifically identified impairments, based on the analysis of internal risk ratings and current loan values. Internal risk ratings are assigned based on the consideration of risk factors including past due status, debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio, property occupancy, profile of the borrower and of the major property tenants, economic trends in the market where the property is located, and condition of the property. These factors and the resulting risk ratings also provide a basis for determining the level of monitoring performed at both the individual loan and the portfolio level. When all or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible, the uncollectible portion of the carrying amount of the loan is charged off against the allowance. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized as cash is received. For impaired loans where it has been determined that not all of the contractual principal due will be collected, any cash received is recorded as a reduction of the current carrying amount of the loan.\nA significant majority of commercial mortgage loans in the portfolio are non-recourse loans and, accordingly, the only guarantees are for specific items that are exceptions to the non-recourse provisions. It is therefore extremely rare for us to have cause to enforce the provisions of a guarantee on a commercial real estate or mortgage loan.\nThe following table presents a rollforward of the changes in the allowance for losses on Mortgage and other loans receivable:\nYears Ended December 31,\nCommercial\nOther\nCommercial\nOther\nCommercial\nOther\n(in millions)\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nAllowance, beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nLoans charged off\n(29)\n(39)\n(68)\n(12)\n(104)\n(116)\n(23)\n(21)\n(44)\nRecoveries of loans previously\ncharged off\nNet charge-offs\n(11)\n(23)\n(34)\n(9)\n(98)\n(107)\n(10)\n(17)\n(27)\nProvision for loan losses\n(31)\n(8)\n(32)\n(136)\n(103)\nOther\n-\n(1)\n(5)\n(6)\n-\n-\n-\nActivity of discontinued operations\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(205)\n(205)\nAllowance, end of year\n$\n159 *\n$\n$\n$\n*\n$\n$\n$\n*\n$\n$\nItem 8 / note 7. LENDING ACTIVITIES\n* Of the total allowance at the end of the year, $55 million and $93 million relates to individually assessed credit losses on $192 million and $264 million of commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nWe modify loans to optimize their returns and improve their collectability, among other things. When we undertake such a modification with a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty and the modification involves us granting a concession to the troubled debtor, the modification is a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). We assess whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty based on a variety of factors, including the borrower’s current default on any of its outstanding debt, the probability of a default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification, the insufficiency of the borrower’s forecasted cash flows to service any of its outstanding debt (including both principal and interest), and the borrower’s inability to access alternative third-party financing at an interest rate that would be reflective of current market conditions for a non-troubled debtor. Concessions granted may include extended maturity dates, interest rate changes, principal or interest forgiveness, payment deferrals and easing of loan covenants.\nDuring 2014 and 2013, loans with a carrying value of $218 million and $91 million were modified in TDRs, respectively.\n8. REINSURANCE\nIn the ordinary course of business, our insurance companies may use both treaty and facultative reinsurance to minimize their net loss exposure to any single catastrophic loss event or to an accumulation of losses from a number of smaller events or to provide greater diversification of our businesses. In addition, our general insurance subsidiaries assume reinsurance from other insurance companies. We determine the portion of the incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss that will be recoverable under our reinsurance contracts by reference to the terms of the reinsurance protection purchased. This determination is necessarily based on the estimate of IBNR and accordingly, is subject to the same uncertainties as the estimate of IBNR. Reinsurance assets include the balances due from reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of our reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses and benefits and loss expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized. We remain liable to the extent that our reinsurers do not meet their obligation under the reinsurance contracts, and as such, we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration of our credit risk. The estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires judgment for which key inputs typically include historical trends regarding uncollectible balances, disputes and credit events as well as specific reviews of balances in dispute or subject to credit impairment. The allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance assets was $258 million and $276 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance assets are reflected in Policyholder benefits and losses incurred within the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table provides supplemental information for loss and benefit reserves, gross and net of ceded reinsurance:\nAt December 31,\nAs\nNet of\nAs\nNet of\n(in millions)\nReported\nReinsurance\nReported\nReinsurance\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses(a)\n$\n(77,260)\n$\n(61,612)\n$\n(81,547)\n$\n(64,316)\nFuture policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts\n(42,749)\n(41,767)\n(40,653)\n(39,619)\nReserve for unearned premiums\n(21,324)\n(18,278)\n(21,953)\n(18,532)\nReinsurance assets(b)\n19,676\n21,686\nItem 8 / note 7. LENDING ACTIVITIES\n(a) In 2014 and 2013, the Net of Reinsurance amount reflects the cession under the June 17, 2011 transaction with National Indemnity Company (NICO) of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\n(b) Represents gross reinsurance assets, excluding allowances and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses.\nShort-Duration Reinsurance\nShort-duration reinsurance is affected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts that protect us against losses above stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are recognized as a reduction of premiums earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on short-duration contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of Reinsurance assets. Assumed reinsurance premiums are earned primarily on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the reinsurance contracts and the portion of premiums relating to the unexpired terms of coverage is included in the reserve for unearned premiums. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met for reinsurance accounting to apply. If risk transfer requirements are not met, the contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. Similar risk transfer criteria are used to determine whether directly written insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or as a deposit.\nThe following table presents short-duration insurance premiums written and earned:\nYears Ended December 31,\nNon-Life Insurance Companies\n(in millions)\nPremiums written:\nDirect\n$\n39,375\n$\n39,833\n$\n40,647\nAssumed\n3,399\n4,306\n4,900\nCeded\n(8,318)\n(9,514)\n(11,054)\nNet\n$\n34,456\n$\n34,625\n$\n34,493\nPremiums earned:\nDirect\n$\n38,707\n$\n39,018\n$\n41,028\nAssumed\n3,258\n3,516\n3,133\nCeded\n(8,140)\n(8,585)\n(9,375)\nNet\n$\n33,825\n$\n33,949\n$\n34,786\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, amounted to $2.6 billion, $3.3 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.\nLong-Duration Reinsurance\nLong-duration reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. The premiums with respect to these treaties are earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection provided. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on long-duration contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of Reinsurance assets.\nThe following table presents premiums for our long-duration insurance and retirement services operations:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\nLife Insurance Companies\nRun-off insurance lines\nTotal\n(in millions)\nGross premiums\n$\n4,059\n$\n4,155\n$\n3,963\n$\n$\n$\n$\n4,070\n$\n4,164\n$\n3,974\nCeded premiums\n(661)\n(620)\n(581)\n-\n-\n-\n(661)\n(620)\n(581)\nNet\n$\n3,398\n$\n3,535\n$\n3,382\n$\n$\n$\n$\n3,409\n$\n3,544\n$\n3,393\nItem 8 / note 8. REINSURANCE\nLong-duration reinsurance recoveries, which reduced Policyholder benefits and losses incurred, were approximately $731 million, $714 million and $758 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.\nThe following table presents long-duration insurance in-force ceded to other insurance companies:\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\n2012*\nLong-duration insurance in force ceded\n$\n180,178\n$\n122,012\n$\n129,159\n* Excludes amounts related to held-for-sale entities.\nLong-duration insurance in force assumed represented 0.04 percent of gross long-duration insurance in force at December 31, 2014, 0.05 percent at December 31, 2013 and 0.05 percent at December 31, 2012, and premiums assumed by the Life Insurance Companies represented 0.5 percent, 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent of gross premiums for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nThe domestic Life Insurance Companies utilize internal and third-party reinsurance relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management strategies, which allows them to minimize the use of letters of credit and utilize capital more efficiently. Pools of highly-rated third-party reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention limits.\nThe domestic Life Insurance Companies manage the capital impact on their statutory reserve requirements under the NAIC Model Regulation “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies” (Regulation XXX) and NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) through intercompany reinsurance transactions. Under GAAP, these intercompany reinsurance transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Under one arrangement, one of the domestic Life Insurance Companies obtains letters of credit to support statutory recognition of the ceded reinsurance. As of December 31, 2014, the domestic Life Insurance Companies had two bilateral letters of credit totaling $450 million with AIG entities, which were issued on February 7, 2014 and expire on February 7, 2019, but will be automatically extended without amendment by one year on each anniversary of the issuance date, unless the issuer provides notice of non-renewal. See Note 20 for additional information on the use of affiliated reinsurance for Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves.\nReinsurance Security\nOur third-party reinsurance arrangements do not relieve us from our direct obligations to our beneficiaries. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both short-duration and long-duration reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed under any reinsurance agreement. We hold substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities, and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of credit risk to AIG. Gross reinsurance assets with our three largest reinsurers aggregate to approximately $6.2 billion and $6.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of which approximately $3.3 billion was not secured by collateral in both years.\n9. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS\nDeferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) represent those costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts. We defer incremental costs that result directly from, and are essential to, the acquisition or renewal of an insurance contract. Such deferred policy acquisition costs generally include agent or broker commissions and bonuses, premium taxes, and medical and inspection fees that would not have been incurred if the insurance contract had not been acquired or renewed. Each cost is analyzed to assess whether it is fully deferrable. We partially defer costs, including certain commissions, when we do not believe that the entire cost is directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts.\nWe also defer a portion of employee total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing specific acquisition or renewal activities, including costs associated with the time spent on underwriting, policy\nItem 8 / note 8. REINSURANCE\nissuance and processing, and sales force contract selling. The amounts deferred are derived based on successful efforts for each distribution channel and/or cost center from which the cost originates.\nShort-duration insurance contracts: Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Investment income is anticipated in assessing the recoverability of DAC. We assess the recoverability of DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income on in-force business to the sum of expected losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, unamortized DAC and maintenance costs. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Increases in expected losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge.\nLong-duration insurance contracts: Policy acquisition costs for participating life, traditional life and accident and health insurance products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, over the premium paying period. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC for these traditional products are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. These “locked-in” assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns, and include margins for adverse deviation to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. A loss recognition event occurs when there is a shortfall between the carrying amounts of future policy benefit liabilities net of DAC and the amount the future policy benefit liabilities net of DAC would be when applying updated current assumptions. When we determine a loss recognition event has occurred, we first reduce any DAC related to that block of business through amortization of acquisition expense, and after DAC is depleted, we record additional liabilities through a charge to Policyholder benefits and losses incurred. Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring and servicing the business and applied by product groupings. We perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities and long-term care products. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle.\nInvestment-oriented contracts: Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In each reporting period, current period amortization expense is adjusted to reflect actual gross profits. If estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC is recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. If the new assumptions indicate that future estimated gross profits are higher than previously estimated, DAC will be increased resulting in a decrease in amortization expense and increase in income in the current period; if future estimated gross profits are lower than previously estimated, DAC will be decreased resulting in an increase in amortization expense and decrease in income in the current period. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the current and projected future profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.\nTo estimate future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, a long-term annual asset growth assumption is applied to determine the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a “reversion to the mean” methodology whereby short-term asset growth above or below long-term annual rate assumptions impact the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions in the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods.\nItem 8 / note 9. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS\nShadow DAC and Shadow Loss Recognition: DAC related to investment-oriented products is also adjusted to reflect the effect of unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale on estimated gross profits, with related changes recognized through Other comprehensive income (shadow DAC). The adjustment is made at each balance sheet date, as if the securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. Similarly, for long-duration traditional insurance contracts, if the assets supporting the liabilities maintain a temporary net unrealized gain position at the balance sheet date, loss recognition testing assumptions are updated to exclude such gains from future cash flows by reflecting the impact of reinvestment rates on future yields. If a future loss is anticipated under this basis, any additional shortfall indicated by loss recognition tests is recognized as a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income (shadow loss recognition). Similar to other loss recognition on long-duration insurance contracts, such shortfall is first reflected as a reduction in DAC and secondly as an increase in liabilities for future policy benefits. The change in these adjustments, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments that is credited or charged directly to Other comprehensive income.\nInternal Replacements of Long-duration and Investment-oriented Products: For some products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. These transactions are known as internal replacements. If the modification does not substantially change the contract, we do not change the accounting and amortization of existing DAC and related actuarial balances. If an internal replacement represents a substantial change, the original contract is considered to be extinguished and any related DAC or other policy balances are charged or credited to income, and any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred.\nValue of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with DAC. This value is based on the present value of future pre-tax profits discounted at yields applicable at the time of purchase. For participating life, traditional life and accident and health insurance products, VOBA is amortized over the life of the business in a manner similar to that for DAC based on the assumptions at purchase. For investment-oriented products, VOBA is amortized in relation to estimated gross profits and adjusted for the effect of unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale in a manner similar to DAC.\nThe following table presents a rollforward of DAC and VOBA:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nNon-Life Insurance Companies:\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n2,493\n$\n2,342\n$\n2,306\nAcquisition costs deferred\n4,805\n4,803\n4,834\nAmortization expense\n(4,599)\n(4,481)\n(4,764)\nOther\n(148)\n(171)\n(34)\nBalance, end of year\n$\n2,551\n$\n2,493\n$\n2,342\nLife Insurance Companies:\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n6,920\n$\n5,815\n$\n6,607\nAcquisition costs deferred\n1,114\n1,034\nAmortization expense\n(727)\n(674)\n(945)\nChange in net unrealized gains (losses) on securities\n(360)\n(621)\nDecrease due to foreign exchange\n(32)\n(39)\n(14)\nOther\n-\n-\nBalance, end of year\n$\n7,258\n$\n6,920\n$\n5,815\nConsolidation and eliminations\nTotal deferred policy acquisition costs*\n$\n9,827\n$\n9,436\n$\n8,182\nSupplemental Information:\nVOBA amortization expense included in Life Insurance Companies DAC amortization\nVOBA, end of year included in Life Insurance Companies DAC balance\n* Net of reductions in DAC of $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.8 billion for Life Insurance Companies at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to the effect of net unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities (shadow DAC).\nThe percentage of the unamortized balance of VOBA at December 31, 2014 expected to be amortized in 2015 through 2019 by year is: 10.1 percent, 8.9 percent, 7.9 percent, 7.2 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, with 59.2 percent being amortized\nItem 8 / note 9. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS\nafter five years. These projections are based on current estimates for investment income and spreads, persistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions.\nDAC, VOBA and SIA for insurance-oriented and investment-oriented products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, AIG’s DAC, VOBA and SIA may be subject to an impairment charge and AIG’s results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.\n10. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nA variable interest entity (VIE) is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity. Consolidation of a VIE by its primary beneficiary is not based on majority voting interest, but is based on other criteria discussed below.\nWe enter into various arrangements with VIEs in the normal course of business and consolidate the VIEs when we determine we are the primary beneficiary. This analysis includes a review of the VIE’s capital structure, related contractual relationships and terms, nature of the VIE’s operations and purpose, nature of the VIE’s interests issued and our involvement with the entity. When assessing the need to consolidate a VIE, we evaluate the design of the VIE as well as the related risks the entity was designed to expose the variable interest holders to.\nFor VIEs with attributes consistent with that of an investment company or a money market fund, the primary beneficiary is the party or group of related parties that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the VIE, receives the majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both.\nFor all other VIEs, the primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. While also considering these factors, the consolidation conclusion depends on the breadth of our decision-making ability and our ability to influence activities that significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE.\nBalance Sheet Classification and Exposure to Loss\nThe following table presents the total assets and total liabilities associated with our variable interests in consolidated VIEs, as classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n(in millions)\nReal Estate and Investment Entities(d)\nSecuritization Vehicles\nStructured Investment\nVehicle\nAffordable Housing Partnerships\nOther\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2014\nAssets:\nBonds available for sale\n$\n-\n$\n11,152\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n11,187\nOther bond securities\n-\n7,251\n-\n7,906\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n-\n2,398\n-\n-\n2,560\nOther invested assets\n-\n1,684\n2,941\nOther(a)\n1,447\n1,752\nTotal assets(b)\n$\n$\n22,899\n$\n$\n1,733\n$\n$\n26,346\nLiabilities:\nLong-term debt\n$\n$\n1,370\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,697\nOther(c)\n-\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n1,646\n$\n$\n$\n$\n2,143\nDecember 31, 2013\nAssets:\nBonds available for sale\n$\n-\n$\n11,028\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n11,098\nOther bond securities\n-\n7,449\n-\n8,310\nMortgage and other loans receivable\n-\n1,508\n-\n-\n1,697\nOther invested assets\n-\n1,986\n3,628\nOther(a)\n1,014\n1,279\nTotal assets(b)\n$\n$\n21,762\n$\n$\n2,027\n$\n$\n26,012\nLiabilities:\nLong-term debt\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nOther(c)\n-\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,549\nItem 8 / note 9.

Interest holders in VIEs sponsored by us generally have recourse only to the assets and cash flows of the VIEs and do not have recourse to us, except in limited circumstances when we have provided a guarantee to the VIE’s interest holders.\nThe following table presents total assets of unconsolidated VIEs in which we hold a variable interest, as well as our maximum exposure to loss associated with these VIEs:\nMaximum Exposure to Loss\nTotal VIE\nOn-Balance\nOff-Balance\n(in millions)\nAssets\nSheet*\nSheet\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2014\nReal estate and investment entities\n$\n19,949\n$\n2,785\n$\n$\n3,239\nAffordable housing partnerships\n7,911\n-\nOther\n-\nTotal\n$\n28,477\n$\n3,242\n$\n$\n3,696\nDecember 31, 2013\nReal estate and investment entities\n$\n17,572\n$\n2,343\n$\n$\n2,632\nAffordable housing partnerships\n8,559\n-\nOther\n-\nTotal\n$\n26,839\n$\n2,857\n$\n$\n3,146\n* At December 31, 2014 and 2013, $3.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, of our total unconsolidated VIE assets were recorded as Other invested assets.\nReal Estate and Investment Entities\nThrough our insurance operations and AIG Global Real Estate, we are an investor in various real estate investment entities, some of which are VIEs. These investments are typically with unaffiliated third-party developers via a partnership or limited liability company structure. The VIEs’ activities consist of the development or redevelopment of commercial, industrial and residential real estate. Our involvement varies from being a passive equity investor or finance provider to actively managing the activities of the VIEs.\nOur insurance operations participate as passive investors in the equity issued by certain third-party-managed hedge and private equity funds that are VIEs. Our insurance operations typically are not involved in the design or establishment of these VIEs, nor do they actively participate in the management of the VIEs.\nItem 8 / note 10. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nSecuritization Vehicles\nWe created certain VIEs that hold investments, primarily in investment-grade debt securities and loans, and issued beneficial interests in these investments. The majority of these beneficial interests are owned by our insurance operations and we maintain the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and bear the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entities that could potentially be significant to the entities. Accordingly, we consolidate these entities and those beneficial interests issued to third-parties are reported as Long-term debt.\nWe also created VIEs for the purpose of acquiring, owning, leasing, maintaining, operating and selling aircraft. We hold beneficial interests, including all the equity interests, in these entities. Other beneficial interests include passive investments by our insurance operations in the majority of the debt issued by these entities. We maintain the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and bear the obligation to absorb economic losses or receive economic benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these entities.\nStructured Investment Vehicle\nThrough DIB, we sponsor Nightingale Finance Ltd., a structured investment vehicle (SIV), which is a VIE. Nightingale Finance Ltd. invests in variable rate, investment-grade debt securities, the majority of which are ABS. We have no equity interest in the SIV, but we maintain the power to direct the activities of the SIV that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and bear the obligation to absorb economic losses that could potentially be significant to the SIV. We are the primary beneficiary and consolidate the SIV.\nAffordable Housing Partnerships\nSunAmerica Affordable Housing Partners, Inc. (SAAHP) organizes and invests in limited partnerships that develop and operate affordable housing qualifying for federal tax credits, in addition to a few market rate properties across the United States. The operating partnerships are VIEs, whose debt is generally non-recourse in nature, and the general partners of which are mostly unaffiliated third-party developers. We do not consolidate an operating partnership if the general partner is an unaffiliated entity and we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. Through approximately 900 partnerships, SAAHP has limited partnership investments in developments with approximately 110,000 apartment units nationwide, and as of December 31, 2014, has syndicated approximately $7.7 billion in partnership equity to other investors who will receive, among other benefits, tax credits under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The pre-tax income of SAAHP is reported as a component of the Consumer Insurance segment.\nRMBS, CMBS, Other ABS and CDOs\nPrimarily through our insurance operations, we are a passive investor in RMBS, CMBS, other ABS and CDOs, the majority of which are issued by domestic special purpose entities. We generally do not sponsor or transfer assets to, or act as the servicer to these asset-backed structures, and were not involved in the design of these entities.\nThrough the DIB, we also invest in CDOs and similar structures, which can be cash-based or synthetic and are managed by third parties. The role of DIB is generally limited to that of a passive investor in structures we do not manage.\nOur maximum exposure in these types of structures is limited to our investment in securities issued by these entities. Based on the nature of our investments and our passive involvement in these types of structures, we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities. We have not included these entities in the above tables; however, the fair values of our investments in these structures are reported in Notes 5 and 6 herein.\nItem 8 / note 10. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nWe use derivatives and other financial instruments as part of our financial risk management programs and as part of our investment operations. Interest rate, currency, equity and commodity swaps, credit contracts (including the super senior credit default swap portfolio), swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as derivatives, recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income, when appropriate. In certain instances, a contract’s transaction price is the best indication of initial fair value. Aggregate asset or liability positions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets only to the extent permitted by qualifying master netting arrangements in place with each respective counterparty. Cash collateral posted with counterparties in conjunction with transactions supported by qualifying master netting arrangements is reported as a reduction of the corresponding net derivative liability, while cash collateral received in conjunction with transactions supported by qualifying master netting arrangements is reported as a reduction of the corresponding net derivative asset.\nDerivatives, with the exception of bifurcated embedded derivatives, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Derivative assets, at fair value and Derivative liabilities, at fair value. A bifurcated embedded derivative is measured at fair value and accounted for in the same manner as a free standing derivative contract. The corresponding host contract is accounted for according to the accounting guidance applicable for that instrument. A bifurcated embedded derivative is generally presented with the host contract in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Notes 5 and 14 herein for additional information on embedded policy derivatives.\nEffective April 1, 2014, we reclassified cross-currency swaps from Interest rate contracts to Foreign exchange contracts. This change was applied prospectively.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts and fair values of our derivative instruments:\nDecember 31, 2014\nDecember 31, 2013\nGross Derivative Assets\nGross Derivative Liabilities\nGross Derivative Assets\nGross Derivative Liabilities\nNotional\nFair\nNotional\nFair\nNotional\nFair\nNotional\nFair\n(in millions)\nAmount\nValue(a)\nAmount\nValue(a)\nAmount\nValue(a)\nAmount\nValue(a)\nDerivatives designated as\nhedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nForeign exchange contracts\n1,794\n-\n-\n1,857\nEquity contracts\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDerivatives not designated\nas hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts\n65,070\n3,743\n45,251\n3,183\n50,897\n3,771\n59,585\n3,849\nForeign exchange contracts\n13,667\n8,516\n1,251\n1,774\n3,789\nEquity contracts(b)\n7,565\n42,387\n1,615\n29,296\n9,840\nCommodity contracts\n-\nCredit contracts\n5,288\n15,459\n1,335\nOther contracts(c)\n36,155\n32,440\n1,408\nTotal derivatives not\ndesignated as hedging\ninstruments\n122,477\n4,799\n101,991\n7,127\n114,494\n4,326\n90,094\n6,009\nTotal derivatives, gross\n$\n123,250\n$\n4,825\n$\n103,914\n$\n7,381\n$\n114,494\n$\n4,326\n$\n92,063\n$\n6,214\n(a) Fair value amounts are shown before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments and offsetting cash collateral.\n(b) There were no derivative assets or notionals related to bifurcated embedded derivatives at December 31, 2014.

Notional amount of derivative liabilities and fair values of derivative liabilities include $39.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2014 and $6.7 billion and $424 million, respectively at December 31, 2013 related to bifurcated embedded derivatives. A bifurcated embedded derivative is generally presented with the host contract in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(c) Consists primarily of contracts with multiple underlying exposures.\nItem 8 / note 11.

(ISDA) agreements. Many of the ISDA agreements also include Credit Support Annex (CSA) provisions, which provide for collateral postings that may vary at various ratings and threshold levels. We attempt to reduce our risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable collateral to be obtained from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis. We minimize the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value and may require additional collateral to be posted upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. In addition, certain derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings or give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction. In the case of some of the derivative transactions, upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings, as an alternative to posting collateral and subject to certain conditions, we may assign the transaction to an obligor with higher debt ratings or arrange for a substitute guarantee of our obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings or take other similar action. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade.\nCollateral posted by us to third parties for derivative transactions was $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In the case of collateral posted under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing, this collateral can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties. Collateral provided to us from third parties for derivative transactions was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We generally can repledge or resell collateral posted under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing.\nOffsetting\nWe have elected to present all derivative receivables and derivative payables, and the related cash collateral received and paid, on a net basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets when a legally enforceable ISDA Master Agreement exists between us and our derivative counterparty. An ISDA Master Agreement is an agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, and such ISDA Master Agreement generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through\nItem 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\na single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions.\nHedge Accounting\nWe designated certain derivatives entered into by GCM with third parties as fair value hedges of available-for-sale investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries. The fair value hedges include foreign currency forwards designated as hedges of the change in fair value of foreign currency denominated available-for-sale securities attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. We previously designated certain interest rate swaps entered into by GCM with third parties as cash flow hedges of certain floating rate debt issued by ILFC, specifically to hedge the changes in cash flows on floating rate debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We de-designated such derivatives as cash flow hedges in December 2012 in connection with ILFC being classified as held-for-sale.\nWe use foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments in net investment hedge relationships to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with our non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. We assess the hedge effectiveness and measure the amount of ineffectiveness for these hedge relationships based on changes in spot exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 we recognized gain of $156 million, and losses of $38 million and $74 million, respectively, included in Change in foreign currency translation adjustments in Other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedge relationships.\nA qualitative methodology is utilized to assess hedge effectiveness for net investment hedges, while regression analysis is employed for all other hedges.\nThe following table presents the gain (loss) recognized in earnings on our derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nGains/(Losses) Recognized in Earnings for:\nIncluding Gains/(Losses) Attributable to:\nHedging\nHedged\nHedge\nExcluded\n(in millions)\nDerivatives(a)\nItems\nIneffectiveness\nComponents\nOther(b)\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nInterest rate contracts:\nRealized capital gains/(losses)\n$\n$\n(2)\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n(1)\nInterest credited to policyholder\naccount balances\n-\n(1)\n-\n-\n(1)\nOther income\n-\n-\n-\nGain/(Loss) on extinguishment of debt\n-\n-\n-\nForeign exchange contracts:\nRealized capital gains/(losses)\n(129)\n-\nInterest credited to policyholder\naccount balances\n-\n(3)\n-\n-\n(3)\nOther income\n-\n-\n-\nGain/(Loss) on extinguishment of debt\n-\n-\n-\nEquity contracts:\nRealized capital gains/(losses)\n(23)\n-\n(1)\n-\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nInterest rate contracts:\nRealized capital gains/(losses)\n$\n(5)\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nInterest credited to policyholder\naccount balances\n-\n(2)\n-\n-\n(2)\nOther income\n-\n-\n-\nForeign exchange contracts:\nRealized capital gains/(losses)\n(187)\n-\n-\nPolicyholder benefits\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther income\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nYear ended December 31, 2012\nInterest rate contracts:\nOther income\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nForeign exchange contracts:\nRealized capital gains/(losses)\n(2)\n-\n-\n-\nItem 8 / note 11.

Gains and losses reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income were previously recorded in Other income. Gains or losses recognized in earnings on derivatives for the ineffective portion were previously recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses).\n(b) Includes $19 million for the year ended December 2012, representing the reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings following the discontinuation of cash flow hedges of ILFC debt.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe following table presents the effect of our derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nGains (Losses)\nYears Ended December 31,\nRecognized in Earnings\n(in millions)\nBy Derivative Type:\nInterest rate contracts(a)\n$\n$\n(331)\n$\n(241)\nForeign exchange contracts\nEquity contracts(b)\n(1,111)\n(644)\nCommodity contracts\n(1)\n(4)\n(1)\nCredit contracts\nOther contracts\nTotal\n$\n$\n1,022\n$\n(143)\nBy Classification:\nNet investment income\nNet realized capital gains (losses)\n(219)\n(516)\nOther income\nPolicyholder benefits and losses incurred\n(13)\n-\nTotal\n$\n$\n1,022\n$\n(143)\n(a) Includes cross currency swaps.\n(b) Includes embedded derivative gains (losses) of $(837) million, $1.2 billion and $(170) million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nGlobal Capital Markets Derivatives\nDerivative transactions between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties are generally centralized through GCM, specifically AIG Markets. The derivatives portfolio of AIG Markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives and also\nItem 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nincludes legacy credit derivatives that have been novated from AIGFP. AIGFP also enters into derivatives to mitigate market risk in its exposures (interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities and equities) arising from its portfolio of remaining transactions.\nGCM follows a policy of minimizing interest rate, currency, commodity, and equity risks associated with investment securities by entering into offsetting positions, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation and depreciation.\nSuper Senior Credit Default Swaps\nCredit default swap transactions were entered into by AIGFP with the intention of earning revenue on credit exposure. In the majority of these transactions, we sold credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. Generally, such credit protection was provided on a “second loss” basis, meaning we would incur credit losses only after a shortfall of principal and/or interest, or other credit events, in respect of the protected loans and debt securities, exceeded a specified threshold amount or level of “first losses.”\nThe following table presents the net notional amount (net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches), fair value of derivative liability before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments and offsetting cash collateral and unrealized market valuation gain of the super senior credit default swap portfolio by asset class:\nFair Value of\nUnrealized Market Valuation\nNet Notional Amount at\nDerivative Liability at\nGain for the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nArbitrage:\nMulti-sector CDOs(a)\n$\n2,619\n$\n3,257\n$\n$\n1,249\n$\n$\nCorporate debt/CLOs(b)(c)\n2,480\n11,832\nTotal\n$\n5,099\n$\n15,089\n$\n$\n1,277\n$\n$\n(a) During 2014, we paid $67 million to counterparties with respect to multi-sector CDOs, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss. Collateral postings with regards to multi-sector CDOs were $852 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n(b) Corporate debt/Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) include $555 million and $1.0 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Collateral postings with regards to corporate debt/CLOs were $147 million and $353 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n(c) On July 17, 2014, AIGFP terminated Corporate Debt Super Senior CDSs with a notional amount of $8.8 billion.\nThe expected weighted average maturity of the super senior credit derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2014 was five years for the multi-sector CDO arbitrage portfolio and three years for the corporate debt/CLO portfolio.\nBecause of long-term maturities of the CDSs in the arbitrage portfolio, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, the net notional amount represents the maximum exposure to loss on the super senior credit default swap portfolio.\nWritten Single Name Credit Default Swaps\nWe have legacy credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits with the intention of earning spread income on credit exposure. Some of these transactions were entered into as part of a long-short strategy to earn the net spread between CDSs written and purchased. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the net notional amounts of these written CDS contracts were $190 million and $373 million, respectively, including ABS CDS transactions purchased from a liquidated multi-sector super senior CDS transaction. These exposures were partially hedged by purchasing offsetting CDS contracts of $5 million and $50 million in net notional amounts at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net unhedged positions of $185 million and $323 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, represent the maximum exposure to loss on these CDS contracts. The average maturity of the written CDS contracts was two years and three years at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair values of derivative liabilities (which represents the carrying amount) of the portfolio of CDS was $25 million and $32 million, respectively.\nItem 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nUpon a triggering event (e.g., a default) with respect to the underlying reference obligations, settlement is generally effected through the payment of the notional amount of the contract to the counterparty in exchange for the related principal amount of securities issued by the underlying credit obligor (physical settlement) or, in some cases, payment of an amount associated with the value of the notional amount of the reference obligations through a market quotation process (cash settlement).\nThese CDS contracts were written under ISDA Master Agreements. The majority of these ISDA Master Agreements include credit support annexes (CSAs) that provide for collateral postings that may vary at various ratings and threshold levels. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, net collateral posted by us under these contracts was $30 million and $38 million, respectively, prior to offsets for other transactions.\nAll Other Derivatives\nOur businesses, other than GCM, also use derivatives and other instruments as part of their financial risk management. Interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps) are used to manage interest rate risk associated with embedded derivatives contained in insurance contract liabilities, fixed maturity securities, outstanding medium- and long-term notes as well as other interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange derivatives (principally foreign exchange forwards and options) are used to economically mitigate risk associated with non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, net capital exposures, and foreign currency transactions. Equity derivatives are used to mitigate financial risk embedded in certain insurance liabilities. The derivatives are effective economic hedges of the exposures that they are meant to offset.\nIn addition to hedging activities, we also enter into derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which include, among other things, credit default swaps and purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity-linked notes and convertible bonds.\nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features\nThe aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments that contain credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was approximately $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. The aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral under these contracts at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was $2.7 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively.\nWe estimate that at December 31, 2014, based on our outstanding financial derivative transactions, a one-notch downgrade of our long-term senior debt ratings to BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), would permit counterparties to make additional collateral calls and permit certain counterparties to elect early termination of contracts, resulting in a negligible amount of corresponding collateral postings and termination payments; a one-notch downgrade to Baa2 by Moody’s Investors’ Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and an additional one-notch downgrade to BBB by S&P would result in approximately $46 million in additional collateral postings and termination payments, and a further one-notch downgrade to Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by S&P would result in approximately $153 million in additional collateral postings and termination payments.\nAdditional collateral postings upon downgrade are estimated based on the factors in the individual collateral posting provisions of the CSA with each counterparty and current exposure as of December 31, 2014. Factors considered in estimating the termination payments upon downgrade include current market conditions, the complexity of the derivative transactions, historical termination experience and other observable market events such as bankruptcy and downgrade events that have occurred at other companies. Our estimates are also based on the assumption that counterparties will terminate based on their net exposure to us. The actual termination payments could significantly differ from our estimates given market conditions at the time of downgrade and the level of uncertainty in estimating both the number of counterparties who may elect to exercise their right to terminate and the payment that may be triggered in connection with any such exercise.\nHybrid Securities with Embedded Credit Derivatives\nWe invest in hybrid securities (such as credit-linked notes) with the intent of generating income, and not specifically to acquire exposure to embedded derivative risk. As is the case with our other investments in RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and ABS, our\nItem 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\ninvestments in these hybrid securities are exposed to losses only up to the amount of our initial investment in the hybrid security. Other than our initial investment in the hybrid securities, we have no further obligation to make payments on the embedded credit derivatives in the related hybrid securities.\nWe elect to account for our investments in these hybrid securities with embedded written credit derivatives at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in Net investment income and Other income. Our investments in these hybrid securities are reported as Other bond securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of these hybrid securities were $6.1 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These securities have par amounts of $12.3 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and both have remaining stated maturity dates that extend to 2052.\n12. GOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. We assess goodwill for impairment at one level below our reportable segments. At December 31, 2014, in consideration of the 2014 segment changes, our reporting units with goodwill are Commercial Insurance - Property Casualty, Consumer Insurance - Personal Insurance, and Consumer Insurance - Life. When a business is transferred from one reporting unit to another, as occurred with the transfer of a portion of the Consumer Insurance - Personal Insurance to Consumer Insurance - Life, as part of the 2014 segment changes, goodwill at the original reporting unit is allocated among reporting units based on the fair value of business transferred, relative to business retained by a reporting unit.\nThe impairment assessment involves an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not performed, or after assessing the totality of the events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which a quantitative assessment for potential impairment is performed.\nIf the qualitative test is not performed or if the test indicates a potential impairment is present, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value involves management judgment and is based on one or a combination of approaches including discounted expected future cash flows, market-based earnings multiples of the unit’s peer companies, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. We consider one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test.\nIf the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess of carrying value over fair value.\nGoodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2014 based on the results of the goodwill impairment test.\nThe following table presents the changes in goodwill by reportable segment:\n(in millions)\nCommercial\nConsumer\nOther\nTotal\nBalance at January 1, 2012:\nGoodwill - gross\n$\n2,325\n$\n2,502\n$\n$\n4,850\nAccumulated impairments\n(1,266)\n(2,211)\n-\n(3,477)\nNet goodwill\n1,059\n1,373\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nAcquisition\n-\n-\nOther\n-\n-\n(23)\n(23)\nBalance at December 31, 2012:\nGoodwill - gross\n2,444\n2,502\n-\n4,946\nAccumulated impairments\n(1,266)\n(2,211)\n-\n(3,477)\nNet goodwill\n1,178\n-\n1,469\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nOther\n-\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2013:\nGoodwill - gross\n2,450\n2,502\n-\n4,952\nAccumulated impairments\n(1,266)\n(2,211)\n-\n(3,477)\nNet goodwill\n1,184\n-\n1,475\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nAcquisition\n-\n-\nOther\n(49)\n-\n-\n(49)\nBalance at December 31, 2014:\nGoodwill - gross\n2,401\n2,530\n-\n4,931\nAccumulated impairments\n(1,266)\n(2,211)\n-\n(3,477)\nNet goodwill\n$\n1,135\n$\n$\n-\n$\n1,454\nItem 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n13. INSURANCE LIABILITIES\nLiability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of unpaid claims, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported and claim adjustments expenses, less applicable discount for future investment income. We continually review and update the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected currently in pre-tax income. Because these estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are common given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.\nOur gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately $12.4 billion and $12.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles (primarily for U.S. commercial casualty business) where we manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured and are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we held collateral totaling $9.4 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and trust agreements.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of activity in the Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, beginning of year\n$\n81,547\n$\n87,991\n$\n91,145\nReinsurance recoverable\n(17,231)\n(19,209)\n(20,320)\nNet liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, beginning of year\n64,316\n68,782\n70,825\nForeign exchange effect(a)\n(1,061)\n(617)\n(90)\nDispositions\n-\n(79)\n(11)\nChanges in net loss reserves due to retroactive asbestos reinsurance transaction\nTotal\n63,396\n68,108\n70,814\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nCurrent year\n21,279\n22,171\n25,385\nPrior years, excluding discount(b)\nPrior years, discount charge (benefit)\n(309)\n(63)\nTotal\n22,460\n22,419\n25,743\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses paid(c):\nCurrent year\n6,358\n7,431\n8,450\nPrior years\n17,886\n18,780\n19,325\nTotal\n24,244\n26,211\n27,775\nBalance, end of year:\nNet liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n61,612\n64,316\n68,782\nReinsurance recoverable\n15,648\n17,231\n19,209\nTotal\n$\n77,260\n$\n81,547\n$\n87,991\nItem 8 / note 12. GOODWILL\n(a) For the 2012 amounts, $847 million was reclassified from \"Foreign exchange effect\" to \"Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid (current year)\". The impact of this reclassification was a decrease of $847 million for foreign exchange and loss expenses paid (current year), with no income statement or balance sheet impact.\n(b) In 2014, included $545 million, $381 million, $(195) million, $135 million and $109 million related to primary casualty, environmental and asbestos, natural catastrophes, financial lines and healthcare, respectively. In 2013, included $(144) million, $269 million, $498 million and $(54) million related to excess casualty, environmental and pollution, primary casualty and healthcare, respectively. In 2012, includes $157 million, $200 million, $531 million and $68 million related to excess casualty, environmental and pollution, primary casualty and healthcare, respectively.\n(c) Includes amounts related to dispositions through the date of disposition.\nThe net adverse development includes loss-sensitive business, for which we recognized $105 million, $89 million and $54 million loss-sensitive premium adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nDiscounting of Reserves\nAt December 31, 2014, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects a net loss reserve discount of $3.1 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations based upon the following assumptions:\n• Certain asbestos business that was written by Non-Life Insurance Companies is discounted, when allowed by the regulator and when payments are fixed and determinable, based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business.\n• The tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated based on a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1999 U.S. Decennial Life Table.\n• The non-tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations (prescribed or permitted) for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies’ own payout patterns. In 2012, for Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies.\n• Effective for the fourth quarter of 2013, our Pennsylvania regulator approved use of a consistent discount rate (U.S. Treasury rate plus a liquidity premium) to all of our workers’ compensation reserves in our Pennsylvania-domiciled companies, as well as our use of updated payout patterns specific to our primary and excess workers compensation portfolios. Prior to this change, workers’ compensation reserves held by a Pennsylvania-domiciled insurer were discounted as follows: i) For loss reserves associated with accident year 2001 and prior accident years, a prescribed discount factor based on a rate of 6 percent and industry payout patterns, were applied, ii) For loss reserves associated with accident year 2002 and subsequent accident years, a rate of 4.25 percent and our own payout patterns were applied; and iii) For a portion of loss reserves comprising excess workers' compensation reserves that were assumed into a Pennsylvania-domiciled insurer from New York-domiciled insurers during 2011, we applied New York discounting rules, which include a prescribed rate of five percent on case reserves only (no discounting of IBNR reserves).\n• In the fourth quarter of 2014, our Pennsylvania and Delaware regulators approved an updated discount rate that we applied to our workers’ compensation loss reserves for the legal entities domiciled in those states.\nThe discount consists of the following: $852 million of tabular discount for workers’ compensation in the domestic operations of Non-Life Insurance Companies and $2.2 billion of non-tabular discount for workers’ compensation in the domestic operations of Non-Life Insurance Companies; and $11 million - non-tabular discount for asbestos for Non-Life Insurance Companies.\nItem 8 / note 13. INSURANCE LIABILITIES\nFuture Policy Benefits\nFuture policy benefits primarily include reserves for traditional life and annuity payout contracts, which represent an estimate of the present value of future benefits less the present value of future net premiums. Included in Future policy benefits are liabilities for annuities issued in structured settlement arrangements whereby a claimant has agreed to settle a general insurance claim in exchange for fixed payments over a fixed determinable period of time with a life contingency feature.\nFuture policy benefits also include certain guaranteed benefits of variable annuity products that are not considered embedded derivatives, primarily guaranteed minimum death benefits. See Note 14 for additional information on guaranteed death benefits.\nThe liability for long-duration future policy benefits has been established including assumptions for interest rates which vary by year of issuance and product, and range from approximately 1 percent to 12 percent. Mortality and surrender rate assumptions are generally based on actual experience when the liability is established.\nFor universal life policies with secondary guarantees, we recognize a future policy benefit reserve, in addition to policyholder contract deposits, based on a benefit ratio of (a) the present value of total expected payments, in excess of the account value, over the life of the contract, divided by (b) the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract. For universal life policies without secondary guarantees, for which profits followed by losses are first expected after contract inception, we establish future policy benefit reserves, in addition to policyholder contract deposits, so that expected future losses are recognized in proportion to the emergence of profits in the earlier (profitable) years.\nPolicyholder Contract Deposits\nThe liability for Policyholder contract deposits is primarily recorded at accumulated value (deposits received and net transfers from separate accounts, plus accrued interest credited at rates ranging from 0.3% to 8.4% at December 31, 2014, less withdrawals and assessed fees). Deposits collected on investment-oriented products are not reflected as revenues, because they are recorded directly to Policyholder contract deposits upon receipt. Amounts assessed against the contract holders for mortality, administrative, and other services are included in revenues.\nIn addition to liabilities for universal life, fixed annuities, fixed options within variable annuities, annuities without life contingencies, funding agreements and GICs, policyholder contract deposits also include our liability for (a) certain guaranteed benefits and indexed features accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, (b) annuities issued in a structured settlement arrangement with no life contingency and (c) certain contracts we have elected to account for at fair value. See Note 14 herein for additional information on guaranteed benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nUnder a funding agreement-backed notes issuance program, an unaffiliated, non-consolidated statutory trust issues medium-term notes to investors, which are secured by GICs issued to the trust by one of our Life Insurance Companies through our Institutional Markets operating segment. During the year ended December 31, 2014, a $450 million GIC was issued in conjunction with the funding agreement-backed notes program.\nThe following table presents Policyholder contract deposits of the domestic Life Insurance Companies by product line:\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\nPolicyholder contract deposits:\nFixed Annuities\n$\n53,370\n$\n54,515\nGroup Retirement\n37,693\n37,695\nLife\n13,717\n13,644\nRetirement Income Solutions\n10,040\n6,729\nInstitutional Markets\n9,793\n9,433\nTotal Policyholder contract deposits\n$\n124,613\n$\n122,016\nItem 8 / note 13. INSURANCE LIABILITIES\nOther Policyholder Funds\nOther policyholder funds include unearned revenue reserves (URR). URR consists of front-end loads on investment-oriented contracts, representing those policy loads that are non-level and typically higher in initial policy years than in later policy years. URR for investment-oriented contracts are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits (EGPs) to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts and are subject to the same adjustments due to changes in the assumptions underlying EGPs as DAC. Amortization of URR is recorded in Policy Fees.\nOther policyholder funds also include provisions for future dividends to participating policyholders, accrued in accordance with all applicable regulatory or contractual provisions. Participating life business represented approximately 1.9 percent of the gross insurance in force at December 31, 2014 and 3.7 percent of gross Premiums and other considerations in 2014. The amount of annual dividends to be paid is approved locally by the boards of directors of the insurance companies. Provisions for future dividend payments are computed by jurisdiction, reflecting local regulations. The portions of current and prior net income and of current unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to our benefit are restricted in some cases by the insurance contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the jurisdictions in which the policies are in force.\nCertain products are subject to experience adjustments. These include group life and group medical products, credit life contracts, accident and health insurance contracts/riders attached to life policies and, to a limited extent, reinsurance agreements with other direct insurers. Ultimate premiums from these contracts are estimated and recognized as revenue with the unearned portions of the premiums recorded as liabilities in Other policyholder funds. Experience adjustments vary according to the type of contract and the territory in which the policy is in force and are subject to local regulatory guidance.\n14. VARIABLE LIFE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS\nWe report variable contracts within the separate accounts when investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contract holder and the separate account meets additional accounting criteria to qualify for separate account treatment. The assets supporting the variable portion of variable annuity and variable universal life contracts that qualify for separate account treatment are carried at fair value and reported as separate account assets, with an equivalent summary total reported as separate account liabilities.\nPolicy values for variable products and investment contracts are expressed in terms of investment units. Each unit is linked to an asset portfolio. The value of a unit increases or decreases based on the value of the linked asset portfolio. The current liability at any time is the sum of the current unit value of all investment units in the separate accounts, plus any liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits or guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits included in Future policy benefits or Policyholder contract deposits, respectively.\nAmounts assessed against the contract holders for mortality, administrative and other services are included in revenue. Net investment income, net investment gains and losses, changes in fair value of assets, and policyholder account deposits and withdrawals related to separate accounts are excluded from the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Cash Flows.\nVariable annuity contracts may include certain contractually guaranteed benefits to the contract holder. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits include guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are mutually exclusive. A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. The net amount at risk for each feature is calculated irrespective of the existence of other features; as a result, the net amount at risk for each feature is not additive to that of other features.\nAccount balances of variable annuity contracts with guarantees were invested in separate account investment options as follows:\nItem 8 / note 13. INSURANCE LIABILITIES\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\nEquity funds\n$\n40,811\n$\n40,497\nBond funds\n7,566\n7,458\nBalanced funds\n22,354\n16,384\nMoney market funds\nTotal\n$\n71,528\n$\n65,206\nGMDB and GMIB\nDepending on the contract, the GMDB feature may provide a death benefit of either (a) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (and in rare instances, no minimum return) or (b) the highest contract value attained, typically on any anniversary date minus any subsequent withdrawals following the contract anniversary. GMIB guarantees a minimum level of periodic income payments upon annuitization. GMDB is our most widely offered benefit; our contracts also include GMIB to a lesser extent.\nThe liabilities for GMDB and GMIB, which are recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments, through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred. The net amount at risk for GMDB represents the amount of benefits in excess of account value if death claims were filed on all contracts on the balance sheet date.\nThe following table presents details concerning our GMDB exposures, by benefit type:\nAt December 31,\nNet Deposits\nNet Deposits\nPlus a Minimum\nHighest Contract\nPlus a Minimum\nHighest Contract\n(dollars in billions)\nReturn\nValue Attained\nReturn\nValue Attained\nAccount value\n$\n$\n$\n$\nNet amount at risk\nAverage attained age of contract holders by product\nRange of guaranteed minimum return rates\n0%-5%\n0-5%\nThe following summarizes GMDB and GMIB liabilities related to variable annuity contracts:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nReserve increase\nBenefits paid\n(67)\n(51)\n(75)\nBalance, end of year\n$\n$\n$\nWe regularly evaluate estimates used to determine the GMDB liability and adjust the additional liability balance, with a related charge or credit to Policyholder benefits and losses incurred, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.\nThe following assumptions and methodology were used to determine the GMDB liability at December 31, 2014:\n• Data used was up to 1,000 stochastically generated investment performance scenarios.\n• Mean investment performance assumption was 8.5 percent.\n• Volatility assumption was 16 percent.\n• For certain products, mortality was assumed to be 85 percent of the 1983 variable annuity minimum guaranteed death benefit table, adjusted for recent experience. For other products, mortality was assumed to be 92 percent to 139 percent of the 2012 individual annuity mortality table.\n• Lapse rates vary by contract type and duration and ranged zero percent to 37 percent.\nItem 8 / note 14. VARIABLE LIFE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS\n• The discount rate ranged from 3.75 percent to 10 percent and is based on the growth rate assumption for the underlying contracts in effect at the time of policy issuance.\nGMWB and GMAV\nCertain of our variable annuity contracts contain optional GMWB benefits and, to a lesser extent, GMAV benefits, which are not currently offered. With a GMWB, the contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract only through a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage per year of the guaranteed amount. If, after the series of withdrawals, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments equal to the remaining guaranteed amount, and, for lifetime GMWB products, the annuity payments continue as long as the covered person(s) is living. With a GMAV benefit, the contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract, provided the contract holder persists until the maturity date.\nThe liabilities for GMWB and GMAV, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other net realized capital gains (losses). The fair value of these embedded derivatives was a net liability of $957 million at December 31, 2014 and a net asset of $37 million at December 31, 2013. See Note 5 herein for discussion of the fair value measurement of guaranteed benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. We had account values subject to GMWB and GMAV that totaled $35 billion and $28.6 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net amount at risk for GMWB represents the present value of minimum guaranteed withdrawal payments, in accordance with contract terms, in excess of account value, assuming no lapses. The net amount at risk for GMAV represents the present value of minimum guaranteed account value in excess of the current account balance, assuming no lapses. The net amount at risk related to these guarantees was $414 million and $63 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. We use derivative instruments and other financial instruments to mitigate a portion of our exposure that arises from GMWB and GMAV benefits.\nSee Note 1 for discussion of presentation changes for policy fees that are related primarily to GMWB embedded derivatives.\n15. DEBT\nOur long-term debt is denominated in various currencies, with both fixed and variable interest rates. Long-term debt is carried at the principal amount borrowed, including unamortized discounts, hedge accounting valuation adjustments and fair value adjustments, when applicable. The interest rates presented in the following table reflect the range of contractual rates in effect at December 31, 2014, including fixed and variable rate issuances.\nThe following table lists our total debt outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

At December 31, 2013, includes debt of consolidated investments held through AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp., AIG Credit Corp., AIGLH and AIG Property Casualty Inc. of $1.5 billion, $111 million, $696 million and $58 million, respectively.\n(c) At December 31, 2013, excludes $21.4 billion related to ILFC as it is classified as a held-for-sale business.\nThe following table presents maturities of long-term debt (including unamortized original issue discount, hedge accounting valuation adjustments and fair value adjustments, when applicable), excluding $3.7 billion in borrowings of debt of consolidated investments:\nDecember 31, 2014\nYear Ending\n(in millions)\nTotal\nThereafter\nDebt issued or guaranteed by AIG:\nAIG general borrowings:\nNotes and bonds payable\n$\n15,570\n$\n$\n1,554\n$\n$\n2,407\n$\n$\n9,254\nSubordinated debt\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nJunior subordinated debt\n2,466\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2,466\nAIGLH notes and bonds payable\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAIGLH junior subordinated debt\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal AIG general borrowings\n19,106\n1,097\n1,554\n2,407\n12,540\nAIG/DIB borrowings supported by assets:\nMIP notes payable\n2,870\n2,019\n-\n-\nSeries AIGFP matched notes and\nbonds payable\n-\n-\n-\n-\nGIAs, at fair value\n4,648\n2,827\nNotes and bonds payable, at fair value\n-\nTotal AIG/DIB borrowings supported by assets\n8,370\n2,386\n1,137\n3,085\nTotal debt issued or guaranteed by AIG\n27,476\n1,980\n2,253\n2,896\n3,544\n1,178\n15,625\nOther subsidiaries notes, bonds, loans\nand mortgages payable\nTotal\n$\n27,534\n$\n2,018\n$\n2,254\n$\n2,897\n$\n3,545\n$\n1,179\n$\n15,641\nUncollateralized and collateralized notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable consisted of the following:\nUncollateralized\nCollateralized\nAt December 31, 2014\nNotes/Bonds/Loans\nLoans and\n(in millions)\nPayable\nMortgages Payable\nTotal\nOther subsidiaries notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable*\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n* AIG does not guarantee any of these borrowings.\nJunior Subordinated Debt\nIn August 2012, we entered into new replacement capital covenants (the New RCCs) for the initial benefit of the holders of our 2.375% Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the Subordinated Notes), in connection with our 5.75% Series A-2 Junior Subordinated\nItem 8 / note 15. DEBT\nDebentures and our 4.875% Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures. We covenanted in each New RCC that, subject to certain exceptions, we would not repay, redeem or purchase, and that none of our subsidiaries would purchase, the applicable series of junior subordinated debentures prior to the scheduled termination date of that New RCC, unless since the date 360 days prior to the date of that repayment, redemption or purchase, we have received a specified amount of net cash proceeds from the sale of common stock or certain other qualifying securities that have certain characteristics that are at least as equity-like as the applicable characteristics of the applicable series of junior subordinated debentures, or we or our subsidiaries have issued a specified amount of common stock in connection with the conversion or exchange of certain convertible or exchangeable securities. In the first quarter of 2013, our obligations under the New RCCs were effectively terminated because one of the termination provisions set forth in the New RCCs was triggered when it was determined that neither series of junior subordinated debentures received equity credit any longer for rating agency purposes.\nIn 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 8.175% Series A-6 Junior Subordinated Debentures.\nAIGLH Junior Subordinated Debentures (Formerly, Liabilities Connected To Trust Preferred Stock)\nIn connection with our acquisition of AIG Life Holdings, Inc. (AIGLH) in 2001, we entered into arrangements with AIGLH with respect to outstanding AIGLH capital securities. In 1996, AIGLH issued capital securities through a trust to institutional investors and funded the trust with AIGLH junior subordinated debentures issued to the trust with the same terms as the capital securities.\nOn July 11, 2013, the AIGLH junior subordinated debentures were distributed to holders of the capital securities, the capital securities were cancelled and the trusts were dissolved. At December 31, 2014, the junior subordinated debentures outstanding consisted of $155 million of 8.5 percent junior subordinated debentures due July 2030, $245 million of 8.125 percent junior subordinated debentures due March 2046 and $136 million of 7.57 percent junior subordinated debentures due December 2045, each guaranteed by AIG Parent.\nCredit Facilities\nThe five-year syndicated credit facility that we entered into on June 19, 2014 (the Five-Year Facility) provides for $4.0 billion of unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit without any limits on the type of borrowings. As of December 31, 2014, a total of $4 billion remains available under the Five-Year Facility. We expect we may draw down on the Five-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Five-Year Facility is summarized in the following table.\nAt December 31, 2014\nAvailable\nEffective\n(in millions)\nSize\nAmount\nExpiration\nDate\nFive-Year Syndicated Credit Facility\n$\n4,000\n$\n4,000\nJune\n6/19/2014\n16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\nIn the normal course of business, various contingent liabilities and commitments are entered into by AIG and our subsidiaries. In addition, AIG Parent guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries.\nAlthough AIG cannot currently quantify its ultimate liability for unresolved litigation and investigation matters, including those referred to below, it is possible that such liability could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated financial condition or its consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows for an individual reporting period.\nItem 8 / note 15. DEBT\nLegal Contingencies\nOverview. In the normal course of business, AIG and our subsidiaries are, like others in the insurance and financial services industries in general, subject to litigation, including claims for punitive damages. In our insurance and mortgage guaranty operations, litigation arising from claims settlement activities is generally considered in the establishment of our liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. However, the potential for increasing jury awards and settlements makes it difficult to assess the ultimate outcome of such litigation. AIG is also subject to derivative, class action and other claims asserted by its shareholders and others alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties by its directors and officers and violations of insurance laws and regulations, as well as federal and state securities laws. In the case of any derivative action brought on behalf of AIG, any recovery would accrue to the benefit of AIG.\nVarious regulatory and governmental agencies have been reviewing certain transactions and practices of AIG and our subsidiaries in connection with industry-wide and other inquiries into, among other matters, certain business practices of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. We have cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, in producing documents and other information in response to subpoenas and other requests.\nAIG’s Subprime Exposure, AIGFP Credit Default Swap Portfolio and Related Matters\nAIG, AIGFP and certain directors and officers of AIG, AIGFP and other AIG subsidiaries have been named in various actions relating to our exposure to the U.S. residential subprime mortgage market, unrealized market valuation losses on AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio, losses and liquidity constraints relating to our securities lending program and related disclosure and other matters (Subprime Exposure Issues).\nConsolidated 2008 Securities Litigation. Between May 21, 2008 and January 15, 2009, eight purported securities class action complaints were filed against AIG and certain directors and officers of AIG and AIGFP, AIG’s outside auditors, and the underwriters of various securities offerings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Southern District of New York), alleging claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). On March 20, 2009, the Court consolidated all eight of the purported securities class actions as In re American International Group, Inc. 2008 Securities Litigation (the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation).\nOn May 19, 2009, the lead plaintiff in the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation filed a consolidated complaint on behalf of purchasers of AIG Common Stock during the alleged class period of March 16, 2006 through September 16, 2008, and on behalf of purchasers of various AIG securities offered pursuant to AIG’s shelf registration statements. The consolidated complaint alleges that defendants made statements during the class period in press releases, AIG’s quarterly and year-end filings, during conference calls, and in various registration statements and prospectuses in connection with the various offerings that were materially false and misleading and that artificially inflated the price of AIG Common Stock. The alleged false and misleading statements relate to, among other things, the Subprime Exposure Issues. The consolidated complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act. On August 5, 2009, defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and on September 27, 2010, the Court denied the motions to dismiss.\nOn April 26, 2013, the Court dismissed all claims against the outside auditors in their entirety, and it also reduced the scope of the Securities Act claims against AIG and defendants other than the outside auditors.\nOn July 15, 2014, lead plaintiffs and all defendants except AIG’s outside auditors accepted a mediator’s proposal to settle the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation for a cash payment by AIG of $960 million (the AIG Settlement). On August 1, 2014, lead plaintiff and AIG’s outside auditors accepted a mediator’s proposal to resolve the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation for a cash payment by the outside auditors (the Auditor Settlement and, collectively with the AIG Settlement, the Settlement). On October 7, 2014, the Court granted lead plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement and Approval of Notice to the Class and scheduled a final settlement approval hearing for March 20, 2015. The deadline for parties to exclude themselves from the Settlement passed on January 5, 2015. The Settlement remains subject to final approval by the Court. On October 22, 2014, AIG made a cash payment of $960 million, which is being held in escrow pending final approval of the AIG Settlement and which will be returned if the AIG Settlement is not approved. The AIG Settlement amount has been accrued.\nItem 8 / note 16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\nIndividual Securities Litigations. Between November 18, 2011 and September 16, 2013, nine separate, though similar, securities actions were filed asserting claims substantially similar to those in the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation against AIG and certain directors and officers of AIG and AIGFP (one such action also names as defendants AIG’s outside auditor and the underwriters of various securities offerings). Two such actions have been voluntarily dismissed; the remainder are now pending in the Southern District of New York. On January 20, 2015, AIG and other defendants filed motions to dismiss some or all of the claims asserted in all such actions pending as of that date. On February 2, 2015, and February 9, 2015, two additional securities actions were filed in the Southern District of New York asserting claims substantially similar to those in the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation against AIG (one of the two actions also names as defendants certain directors and officers of AIG and AIGFP, and AIG’s outside auditor and certain of AIG’s underwriters during the relevant period).\nWe have accrued our current estimate of probable loss with respect to the pending litigations and other potential related litigations.\nERISA Actions - Southern District of New York. Between June 25, 2008 and November 25, 2008, AIG, certain directors and officers of AIG, and members of AIG’s Retirement Board and Investment Committee were named as defendants in eight purported class action complaints asserting claims on behalf of participants in certain pension plans sponsored by AIG or its subsidiaries. The Court subsequently consolidated these eight actions as In re American International Group, Inc. ERISA Litigation II. On December 19, 2014, lead plaintiffs’ counsel filed under seal a third consolidated amended complaint. The action purports to be brought as a class action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), on behalf of all participants in or beneficiaries of certain benefit plans of AIG and its subsidiaries that offered shares of AIG Common Stock. In the third consolidated amended complaint, plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary responsibilities to plan participants and their beneficiaries under ERISA, by continuing to offer the AIG Stock Fund as an investment option in the plans after it allegedly became imprudent to do so. The alleged ERISA violations relate to, among other things, the defendants’ purported failure to monitor and/or disclose certain matters, including the Subprime Exposure Issues.\nOn January 6, 2015, the parties informed the Court that they had accepted a mediator’s proposal to settle the action for $40 million. On January 7, 2015, the Court removed all previously scheduled deadlines from the Court’s calendar, subject to the parties’ submission of settlement papers to the Court seeking an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement and providing for notice to the class and a final settlement hearing. The entirety of the $40 million settlement is expected to be paid by AIG’s fiduciary liability insurance carriers.\nCanadian Securities Class Action - Ontario Superior Court of Justice. On November 12, 2008, an application was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for leave to bring a purported class action against AIG, AIGFP, certain directors and officers of AIG and Joseph Cassano, the former Chief Executive Officer of AIGFP, pursuant to the Ontario Securities Act. If the Court grants the application, a class plaintiff will be permitted to file a statement of claim against defendants. The proposed statement of claim would assert a class period of March 16, 2006 through September 16, 2008 and would allege that during this period defendants made false and misleading statements and omissions in quarterly and annual reports and during oral presentations in violation of the Ontario Securities Act.\nOn April 17, 2009, defendants filed a motion record in support of their motion to stay or dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. On July 12, 2010, the Court adjourned a hearing on the motion pending a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in a pair of actions captioned Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda 2012 SCC 17. On April 18, 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the standard for determining jurisdiction over foreign and out-of-province defendants, such as AIG, by holding that a defendant must have some form of “actual,” as opposed to a merely “virtual,” presence to be deemed to be “doing business” in the jurisdiction. The Supreme Court of Canada also suggested that in future cases, defendants may contest jurisdiction even when they are found to be doing business in a Canadian jurisdiction if their business activities in the jurisdiction are unrelated to the subject matter of the litigation. The matter has been stayed pending further developments in the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation. Plaintiff has not yet moved to lift the stay.\nIn plaintiff’s proposed statement of claim, plaintiff alleged general and special damages of $500 million and punitive damages of $50 million plus prejudgment interest or such other sums as the Court finds appropriate. As of February 20, 2015, the Court has not determined whether it has jurisdiction or granted plaintiff’s application to file a statement of claim, no merits discovery has occurred and the action has been stayed. As a result, we are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation.\nItem 8 / note 16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\nStarr International Litigation\nOn November 21, 2011, Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO) filed a complaint against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims (the Court of Federal Claims), bringing claims, both individually and on behalf of the classes defined below and derivatively on behalf of AIG (the SICO Treasury Action). The complaint challenges the government’s assistance of AIG, pursuant to which AIG entered into a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRBNY, and such credit facility, the FRBNY Credit Facility) and the United States received an approximately 80 percent ownership in AIG. The complaint alleges that the interest rate imposed on AIG and the appropriation of approximately 80 percent of AIG’s equity was discriminatory, unprecedented, and inconsistent with liquidity assistance offered by the government to other comparable firms at the time and violated the Equal Protection, Due Process, and Takings Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\nIn rulings dated July 2, 2012 and September 17, 2012, the Court of Federal Claims largely denied the United States’ motion to dismiss in the SICO Treasury Action.\nIn the SICO Treasury Action, the only claims naming AIG as a party (as a nominal defendant) are derivative claims on behalf of AIG. On September 21, 2012, SICO made a pre-litigation demand on our Board demanding that we pursue the derivative claims or allow SICO to pursue the claims on our behalf. On January 9, 2013, our Board unanimously refused SICO’s demand in its entirety and on January 23, 2013, counsel for the Board sent a letter to counsel for SICO describing the process by which our Board considered and refused SICO’s demand and stating the reasons for our Board’s determination.\nOn March 11, 2013, SICO filed a second amended complaint in the SICO Treasury Action alleging that its demand was wrongfully refused. On June 26, 2013, the Court of Federal Claims granted AIG’s and the United States’ motions to dismiss SICO’s derivative claims in the SICO Treasury Action and denied the United States’ motion to dismiss SICO’s direct claims.\nOn March 11, 2013, the Court of Federal Claims in the SICO Treasury Action granted SICO’s motion for class certification of two classes with respect to SICO’s non-derivative claims: (1) persons and entities who held shares of AIG Common Stock on or before September 16, 2008 and who owned those shares on September 22, 2008; and (2) persons and entities who owned shares of AIG Common Stock on June 30, 2009 and were eligible to vote those shares at AIG’s June 30, 2009 annual meeting of shareholders. SICO has provided notice of class certification to potential members of the classes, who, pursuant to a court order issued on April 25, 2013, had to return opt-in consent forms by September 16, 2013 to participate in either class. 286,908 holders of AIG Common Stock during the two class periods have opted into the classes.\nTrial in the SICO Treasury Action began in the Court of Federal Claims on September 29, 2014, and witness testimony concluded on November 24, 2014. SICO argued during trial that the two classes are entitled to a total of approximately $40 billion in damages, plus interest. The parties are in the process of post-trial briefing.\nWhile AIG is no longer a party to the SICO Treasury Action, the United States has alleged, as an affirmative defense in its answer, that AIG is obligated to indemnify the FRBNY and its representatives, including the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the United States (as the FRBNY’s principal), for any recovery in the SICO Treasury Action, and seeks a contingent offset or recoupment for the value of net operating loss benefits the United States alleges that we received as a result of the government’s assistance. On November 8, 2013, the Court denied a motion by SICO to strike the United States’ affirmative defenses of indemnification and contingent offset or recoupment.\nAIG believes that any such indemnification obligation would arise only if: (a) SICO prevails on its claims at trial and receives an award of damages and prevails through any appellate process; (b) the United States commences an action against AIG seeking indemnification; and (c) the United States is successful in such an action through any appellate process. If SICO prevails on its claims and the United States seeks indemnification from AIG, AIG intends to assert defenses thereto. A final determination that the United States is liable for damages, together with a final determination that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States for any such damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nItem 8 / note 16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\nFalse Claims Act Complaint\nOn February 25, 2010, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California by two individuals (Relators) seeking to assert claims on behalf of the United States against AIG and certain other defendants, including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, under the False Claims Act. Relators filed a first amended complaint on September 30, 2010, adding certain additional defendants, including Bank of America and Société Générale. The first amended complaint alleged that defendants engaged in fraudulent business practices in respect of their activities in the over-the-counter market for collateralized debt obligations, and submitted false claims to the United States in connection with the FRBNY Credit Facility and Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and Maiden Lane III LLC entities (the Maiden Lane Interests) through, among other things, misrepresenting AIG’s ability and intent to repay amounts drawn on the FRBNY Credit Facility, and misrepresenting the value of the securities that the Maiden Lane Interests acquired from AIG and certain of its counterparties. The first amended complaint sought unspecified damages pursuant to the False Claims Act in the amount of three times the damages allegedly sustained by the United States as well as interest, attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. The complaint and the first amended complaint were initially filed and maintained under seal while the United States considered whether to intervene in the action. On or about April 28, 2011, after the United States declined to intervene, the District Court lifted the seal, and Relators served the first amended complaint on AIG on July 11, 2011. On April 19, 2013, the Court granted AIG’s motion to dismiss, dismissing the first amended complaint in its entirety, without prejudice, giving the Relators the opportunity to file a second amended complaint. On May 24, 2013, the Relators filed a second amended complaint, which attempted to plead the same claims as the prior complaints and did not specify an amount of alleged damages. AIG and its co-defendants filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint on August 9, 2013. On March 29, 2014, the Court dismissed the second amended complaint with prejudice. On April 30, 2014, the Relators filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation.\nLitigation Matters Relating to AIG’s Insurance Operations\nCaremark. AIG and certain of its subsidiaries have been named defendants in two putative class actions in state court in Alabama that arise out of the 1999 settlement of class and derivative litigation involving Caremark Rx, Inc. (Caremark). The plaintiffs in the second-filed action intervened in the first-filed action, and the second-filed action was dismissed. An excess policy issued by a subsidiary of AIG with respect to the 1999 litigation was expressly stated to be without limit of liability. In the current actions, plaintiffs allege that the judge approving the 1999 settlement was misled as to the extent of available insurance coverage and would not have approved the settlement had he known of the existence and/or unlimited nature of the excess policy. They further allege that AIG, its subsidiaries, and Caremark are liable for fraud and suppression for misrepresenting and/or concealing the nature and extent of coverage.\nThe complaints filed by the plaintiffs and the intervenors request compensatory damages for the 1999 class in the amount of $3.2 billion, plus punitive damages. AIG and its subsidiaries deny the allegations of fraud and suppression, assert that information concerning the excess policy was publicly disclosed months prior to the approval of the settlement, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and that the statute cannot be tolled in light of the public disclosure of the excess coverage. The plaintiffs and intervenors, in turn, have asserted that the disclosure was insufficient to inform them of the nature of the coverage and did not start the running of the statute of limitations.\nOn August 15, 2012, the trial court entered an order granting plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and on September 12, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed that order. AIG and the other defendants have petitioned for rehearing of that decision. Absent further review of the class certification order, the matter will return to the trial court for general discovery (which has not yet commenced) and adjudication of the merits. AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation.\nRegulatory and Related Matters\nIn April 2007, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) formed a Settlement Review Working Group, directed by the State of Indiana, to review the Workers’ Compensation Residual Market Assessment portion of the settlement between AIG, the Office of the New York Attorney General, and the New York State Department of Insurance. In late 2007, the Settlement Review Working Group, under the direction of Indiana, Minnesota and Rhode Island, recommended that a multi-state targeted market conduct examination focusing on workers’ compensation insurance be commenced under the\nItem 8 / note 16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\ndirection of the NAIC’s Market Analysis Working Group. AIG was informed of the multi-state targeted market conduct examination in January 2008. The lead states in the multi-state examination were Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. All other states (and the District of Columbia) agreed to participate in the multi-state examination. The examination focused on legacy issues related to certain AIG entities’ writing and reporting of workers compensation insurance between 1985 and 1996.\nOn December 17, 2010, AIG and the lead states reached an agreement to settle all regulatory liabilities arising out of the subjects of the multistate examination. This regulatory settlement agreement, which was agreed to by all 50 states and the District of Columbia, included, among other terms, (i) AIG’s payment of $100 million in regulatory fines and penalties; (ii) AIG’s payment of $46.5 million in outstanding premium taxes and assessments; (iii) AIG’s agreement to enter into a compliance plan describing agreed-upon specific steps and standards for evaluating AIG’s ongoing compliance with state regulations governing the setting of workers’ compensation insurance premium rates and the reporting of workers compensation premiums; and (iv) AIG’s agreement to pay up to $150 million in contingent fines in the event that AIG fails to comply substantially with the compliance plan requirements. In furtherance of the compliance plan, the agreement provided for a monitoring period from May 29, 2012 to May 29, 2014 leading up to a compliance plan examination. After the close of the monitoring period, as part of preparation for the actual conduct of the compliance plan examination, on or about October 1, 2014, AIG and the lead states agreed upon corrective action plans to address particular issues identified during the monitoring period. The compliance plan examination is ongoing. There can be no assurance that the result of the compliance plan examination will not result in a fine, have a material adverse effect on AIG’s ongoing operations or lead to civil litigation.\nIn connection with a multi-state examination of certain accident and health products, including travel products, issued by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (National Union), AIG Property Casualty Inc. (formerly Chartis Inc.), on behalf of itself, National Union, and certain of AIG Property Casualty Inc.’s insurance and non-insurance companies (collectively, the AIG PC parties) entered into a Regulatory Settlement Agreement with regulators from 50 U.S. jurisdictions effective November 29, 2012. Under the agreement, and without admitting any liability for the issues raised in the examination, the AIG PC parties (i) paid a civil penalty of $50 million, (ii) entered into a corrective action plan describing agreed-upon specific steps and standards for evaluating the AIG PC parties’ ongoing compliance with laws and regulations governing the issues identified in the examination, and (iii) agreed to pay a contingent fine in the event that the AIG PC parties fail to satisfy certain terms of the corrective action plan. National Union and other AIG companies are also currently subject to civil litigation relating to the conduct of their accident and health business, and may be subject to additional litigation relating to the conduct of such business from time to time in the ordinary course. There can be no assurance that any regulatory action resulting from the issues identified will not have a material adverse effect on our ongoing operations of the business subject to the agreement, or on similar business written by other AIG carriers.\nIndustry-wide examinations conducted by the Minnesota Department of Insurance and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on captive reinsurance practices by lenders and mortgage insurance companies, including UGC, have been ongoing for several years. In 2011, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) assumed responsibility for violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act from HUD, and assumed HUD’s aforementioned ongoing investigation. UGC and the CFPB reached a settlement, entered on April 8, 2013 by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, where UGC consented to discontinue its remaining captive reinsurance practices and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $4.5 million to the CFPB. The settlement includes a release for all liability related to UGC’s captive reinsurance practices and resolves the CFPB’s investigation. On January 31, 2014, PHH Corp. and various affiliates (all non-parties to the action and the consent order) filed a motion to reopen the case and to intervene therein for the limited purpose of obtaining a declaratory judgment enforcing the consent order. UGC opposed this request, and on March 10, 2014, the Court denied PHH Corp.’s motion. PHH Corp. has appealed to the Eleventh Circuit.\nUGC has received a proposed consent order from the Minnesota Commissioner of Commerce (the MN Commissioner) which alleges that UGC violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and other state laws in connection with its practices with captive reinsurance companies owned by lenders. UGC is engaged in discussions with the MN Commissioner with respect to the terms of the proposed consent order. UGC cannot predict if or when a consent order may be entered into or, if entered into, what the terms of the final consent order will be. UGC has been subject to civil litigation relating to its placement of reinsurance with captives owned by lenders, and may be subject to additional litigation relating to the conduct of such business from time to time in the ordinary course.\nAIG is responding to subpoenas from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office (NYDA) relating to AIG’s formerly wholly owned subsidiaries, ALICO and Delaware American Life Insurance\nItem 8 / note 16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\nCompany (DelAm), and other related business units, which were sold by AIG to MetLife in November 2010. The inquiries relate to whether ALICO, DelAm and their representatives conducted insurance business in New York over an extended period of time without a license, and whether certain representations by ALICO concerning its activities in New York were accurate. On or about March 31, 2014, a consent order between MetLife and the NYDFS, whereby MetLife agreed to pay $50 million, and a deferred prosecution agreement with the NYDA, whereby MetLife agreed to pay $10 million, were announced. AIG was not a party to either settlement. The consent order between the NYDFS and MetLife made certain findings, including that former AIG subsidiaries and affiliates conducted insurance business in New York without a license and that ALICO, while operating as a subsidiary of AIG, made misrepresentations and omissions concerning its insurance business activities in New York to NYDFS’s predecessor agency, the New York State Department of Insurance. The NYDFS also found in the consent order that AIG had violated the New York Insurance Law. On April 3, 2014, AIG filed a complaint against the NYDFS and NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky in the Southern District of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the NYDFS’s interpretation of the New York Insurance Law is unconstitutional under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, as well as the First Amendment, of the U.S. Constitution. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the federal complaint on May 16, 2014. On October 31, 2014, AIG and NYDFS entered into a Consent Order, whereby AIG agreed to pay $35 million and dismiss the federal lawsuit in exchange for NYDFS’s agreement to discontinue its inquiry.\nOn May 12, 2010, a complaint was filed under seal in the Southern District of New York by an individual (Relator) seeking to assert claims on behalf of the United States against AIG under the False Claims Act. The Relator filed also under seal a first amended complaint on July 28, 2011. The complaint and the first amended complaint were initially filed and maintained under seal while the United States considered whether to intervene in the action, and on or about October 29, 2013, after the United States declined to intervene, the District Court ordered the complaint be unsealed 30 days after the entry of the order. The case, however, was not unsealed until May 9, 2014. The Relator thereafter served his second amended complaint on AIG on May 23, 2014. The second amended complaint alleges that AIG made false statements relevant to the valuation of two of its former subsidiaries, ALICO and American International Assurance Limited (AIA), in connection with agreements under which interests in those subsidiaries were transferred to the FRBNY in exchange for a $25 billion decrease in the amount owed to the FRBNY under the FRBNY Credit Facility. Specifically, it alleges that AIG falsely told the federal government that ALICO and AIA had the licenses they needed to conduct their business and were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. AIG moved to dismiss the Relator’s second amended complaint on December 22, 2014.\nAs previously disclosed in prior quarters, a state regulatory agency has requested additional information relating to the unwinding of a position on which we realized gains of $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLegal Reserves\nWe recorded increases in our legal reserve liability of $507 million and $391 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOther Contingencies\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nAlthough we regularly review the adequacy of the established Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, there can be no assurance that our loss reserves will not develop adversely and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process, particularly for long-tail casualty lines of business, which include, but are not limited to, general liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental, workers’ compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers and products liability. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Reserves with respect to a number of years may be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in global\nItem 8 / note 16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\neconomic conditions, changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment, changes in medical cost trends (for example, inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services), underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling practices.\nCommitments\nWe occupy leased space in many locations under various long-term leases and have entered into various leases covering the long-term use of data processing equipment.\nThe following table presents the future minimum lease payments under operating leases at December 31, 2014:\n(in millions)\n$\nRemaining years after 2019\nTotal\n$\n1,304\nRent expense was $471 million, $414 million and $445 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts include $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to ILFC prior to the sale in 2014, and $15 million and $16 million attributable to businesses held for sale for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nOther Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into commitments to invest in limited partnerships, private equity funds and hedge funds and to purchase and develop real estate in the U.S. and abroad. These commitments totaled $2.5 billion at December 31, 2014.\nGuarantees\nSubsidiaries\nWe have issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and those arising from transactions entered into by AIG Markets.\nIn connection with AIGFP’s business activities, AIGFP has issued, in a limited number of transactions, standby letters of credit or similar facilities to equity investors of structured leasing transactions in an amount equal to the termination value owing to the equity investor by the lessee in the event of a lessee default (the equity termination value) that are not otherwise satisfied by other arrangements. The total amount outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2014 was $214 million. In those transactions, AIGFP has agreed to pay the equity termination value if the lessee fails to pay. The amount payable by AIGFP is, in certain cases, partially offset by amounts payable under other instruments typically equal to the present value of scheduled payments to be made by AIGFP. In the event that AIGFP is required to make a payment to the equity investor, the lessee is unconditionally obligated to reimburse AIGFP. To the extent that the equity investor is paid the equity termination value from the standby letter of credit and/or other sources, including payments by the lessee, AIGFP takes an assignment of the equity investor’s rights under the lease of the underlying property. Because the obligations of the lessee under the lease transactions are generally economically defeased, lessee bankruptcy is the most likely circumstance in which AIGFP would be required to pay without reimbursement.\nItem 8 / note 16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\nAsset Dispositions\nGeneral\nWe are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with the sales of businesses that occurred pursuant to our asset disposition plan. The various arrangements may be triggered by, among other things, declines in asset values, the occurrence of specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, developments in litigation or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants made by us. These arrangements are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or are not applicable.\nWe are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential liability under certain of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments related to the sales subject to these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 herein for additional information on sales of businesses and asset dispositions.\nOther\n• See Note 10 for commitments and guarantees associated with VIEs.\n• See Note 11 for disclosures about derivatives.\n• See Note 26 for additional disclosures about guarantees of outstanding debt.\n17.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\nDividends\nPayment of future dividends to our shareholders and repurchases of AIG Common Stock depends in part on the regulatory framework that we are currently subject to and that will ultimately be applicable to us, including as a nonbank systemically important financial institution under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank) and a global systemically important insurer. In addition, dividends are payable on AIG Common Stock only when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors in its discretion, from funds legally available therefor. In considering whether to pay a dividend or purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, our Board of Directors considers such matters as the performance of our businesses, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, available capital, the existence of investment opportunities, contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries, rating agency considerations, including the potential effect on our debt ratings, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nOn March 25, 2014, AIG paid a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock to shareholders of record on March 11, 2014. On June 24, 2014, AIG paid a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock to shareholders of record on June 10, 2014. On September 25, 2014, AIG paid a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock to shareholders of record on September 11, 2014. On December 18, 2014, AIG paid a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock to shareholders of record on December 4, 2014.\nRepurchase of AIG Common Stock in 2014 and 2013\nOn August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock, with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.0 billion, from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $597 million pursuant to this authorization.\nOn February 13, 2014, June 5, 2014 and October 31, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized increases to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of an aggregate of $4.5 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased approximately 88 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion.\nIn the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014, we executed five accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreements with third-party financial institutions. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of those shares, each as set forth above, reflect our payment of approximately $3.1 billion in the aggregate under the ASR agreements and the receipt of approximately 53 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 9.2 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR agreement executed in December 2014. That ASR agreement settled in January 2015, at which time we received approximately 3.5 million additional shares of AIG Common Stock based on a formula specified by the terms of the ASR agreement.\nThe timing of any future repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors.\nAIG Common Stock Offerings by the Department of the Treasury and AIG Purchases of AIG Common Stock in 2012\nThrough registered public offerings, the Department of the Treasury disposed of all of its ownership of AIG Common Stock as of December 31, 2012, from ownership of approximately 92 percent (1.7 billion shares) prior to the completion of the first registered public offering initiated by the Department of the Treasury as selling shareholder in May 2011. During 2012, the Department of the Treasury, as selling shareholder, completed registered public offerings of AIG Common Stock on March 13 (the March Offering), May 10 (the May Offering), August 8 (the August Offering), September 14 (the September Offering) and December 14 (the December Offering). We participated as a purchaser in the first four 2012 offerings. Each of these purchases was authorized by our Board of Directors.\nItem 8 / note 17.

EQUITY\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\nNonvoting, callable, junior preferred interests held by the Department of Treasury represented preferred interests in the AIA SPV and ALICO SPV. In connection with the execution of our orderly asset disposition plan, as well as the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility, we transferred two of our wholly-owned businesses, AIA and ALICO, to two newly created SPVs in exchange for all the common and preferred interests (the SPV Preferred Interests) of those SPVs. On December 1, 2009, AIG transferred the SPV Preferred Interests to the FRBNY in consideration for a $25 billion reduction of the outstanding loan balance and of the maximum amount of credit available under the FRBNY Credit Facility and amended the terms of the FRBNY Credit Facility. As part of the closing of the Recapitalization, the remaining SPV Preferred Interests, with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $20.3 billion at January 14, 2011, were purchased from the FRBNY by AIG and transferred to the Department of the Treasury as part of the consideration for the exchange of our Series F Preferred Stock.\nThe common interests, which we retained, entitled us to 100 percent of the voting power of the SPVs. The voting power allowed us to elect the boards of managers of the SPVs, who oversaw the management and operation of the SPVs. Primarily due to the substantive participation rights of the SPV Preferred Interests, the SPVs were determined to be VIEs. As the primary beneficiary of the SPVs, we consolidated the SPVs.\nItem 8 / note 18. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nAs a result of the closing of the Recapitalization on January 14, 2011, the SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury were no longer considered permanent equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests. As part of the Recapitalization, we used approximately $6.1 billion of the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests. The liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests was further reduced by approximately $12.4 billion using proceeds from the sale of AIG Star, AIG Edison, Nan Shan, and MetLife securities received in the sale of ALICO. During the first quarter of 2011, the remaining liquidation preference of the ALICO SPV Preferred Interests was paid in full.\nThe SPV Preferred Interests were measured at fair value on their issuance date. The SPV Preferred Interests initially had a liquidation preference of $25 billion and had a preferred return of five percent per year compounded quarterly through September 22, 2013 and nine percent thereafter. The preferred return is reflected in Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests - Nonvoting, callable, junior and senior preferred interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The difference between the SPV Preferred Interests’ fair value and the initial liquidation preference was amortized and included in Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests - Nonvoting, callable, junior and senior preferred interests.\nDuring the first quarter of 2012, the liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests was paid down in full.\nNon-redeemable noncontrolling interests\nNon-redeemable noncontrolling interests include the equity interests of third-party shareholders in our consolidated subsidiaries and includes the preferred shareholders’ equity in outstanding preferred stock of ILFC, a wholly-owned subsidiary that was held for sale at December 31, 2013 and 2012. The preferred stock in ILFC consisted of 1,000 shares of market auction preferred stock (MAPS) in two series (Series A and B) of 500 shares each. Each of the MAPS shares had a liquidation value of $100,000 per share and was not convertible. Dividends on the MAPS were accounted for as a reduction of the noncontrolling interest. The dividend rate, other than the initial rate, for each dividend period for each series was reset approximately every seven weeks (49 days) on the basis of orders placed in an auction, provided such auctions were able to occur. The MAPS were transferred as part of the sale of ILFC.\nOn May 14, 2014, we completed the sale of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) to AerCap Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap). See Note 4 - Held-For-Sale Classification and Discontinued Operations for further discussion.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Noncontrolling interests balance declined by $237 million and $56 million, respectively, primarily caused by distributions to noncontrolling interest.\n19. EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)\nThe basic EPS computation is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. The diluted EPS computation is based on those shares used in the basic EPS computation plus shares that would have been outstanding assuming issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding and adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits.\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted EPS:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions, except per share data)\nNumerator for EPS:\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n7,574\n$\n9,008\n$\n3,699\nLess: Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests:\nNonvoting, callable, junior and senior preferred interests\n-\n-\nOther\n(5)\nTotal net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(5)\nIncome attributable to AIG common shareholders from continuing operations\n7,579\n9,001\n3,437\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations\n(50)\nIncome (loss) attributable to AIG common shareholders from discontinued operations\n(50)\nNet income attributable to AIG common shareholders\n$\n7,529\n$\n9,085\n$\n3,438\nDenominator for EPS:\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic\n1,427,959,799\n1,474,171,690\n1,687,197,038\nDilutive shares\n19,593,853\n7,035,107\n29,603\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted*\n1,447,553,652\n1,481,206,797\n1,687,226,641\nIncome per common share attributable to AIG:\nBasic:\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n5.31\n$\n6.11\n$\n2.04\nIncome from discontinued operations\n$\n(0.04)\n$\n0.05\n$\n-\nNet Income attributable to AIG\n$\n5.27\n$\n6.16\n$\n2.04\nDiluted:\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n5.24\n$\n6.08\n$\n2.04\nIncome from discontinued operations\n$\n(0.04)\n$\n0.05\n$\n-\nNet Income attributable to AIG\n$\n5.20\n$\n6.13\n$\n2.04\nItem 8 / note 18. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n* Dilutive shares primarily result from share-based employee compensation plans and a weighted average portion of the warrants issued to AIG shareholders as part of the recapitalization in January 2011. The number of shares excluded from diluted shares outstanding were 0.3 million, 38 million and 78 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, because the effect of including those shares in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.\n20.

EARNINGS PER SHARE\n(a) Excludes discontinued operations and other divested businesses. Statutory capital and surplus and net income (loss) with respect to foreign operations are as of November 30.\n(b) Non-Life Insurance Companies did not recognize material statutory gains related to legal entity simplification (restructuring) in 2014. Non-Life Insurance Companies include approximately $8.0 billion of recognized statutory gains related to legal entity simplification (restructuring) in 2013. These recognized gains were largely offset by reductions in unrealized gains; therefore, there was no material impact to total surplus.\n(c) In aggregate, the 2013 Non-Life Insurance Companies and Life Insurance Companies statutory net income (loss) and statutory capital and surplus amounts increased by $1.1 billion and $557 million, respectively, compared to the amounts previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to finalization of statutory filings.\nOur insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic and foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The principal differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for domestic companies are that statutory financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost, investment impairments are determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices, assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance, policyholder liabilities are generally valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets are non-admitted.\nFor domestic insurance subsidiaries, aggregate minimum required statutory capital and surplus is based on the greater of the RBC level that would trigger regulatory action or minimum requirements per state insurance regulation. Capital and surplus requirements of our foreign subsidiaries differ from those prescribed in the U.S., and can vary significantly by jurisdiction. At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, all domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded the minimum required statutory capital and surplus requirements and all domestic insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded RBC minimum required levels.\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, the use of prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices by our domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries did not result in reported statutory surplus or risk-based capital that is significantly different from the statutory surplus or risk-based capital that would have been reported had NAIC statutory accounting practices or the prescribed regulatory accounting practices of their respective foreign regulatory authority been followed in all respects for domestic and foreign insurance entities. As described in Note 13, our domestic insurance subsidiaries domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania discount non-tabular workers’ compensation reserves based on the prescribed or approved regulations in each of those states. While these practices differ from applicable NAIC statutory accounting practices, such practices do not have a material impact on our statutory surplus and statutory net income (loss) or risk based capital.\nThe NAIC Model Regulation “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies” (Regulation XXX) requires U.S. life insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees (ULSGs). In addition, NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to these guarantees, including certain ULSGs.\nDomestic insurance subsidiaries manage the capital impact of statutory reserve requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX through intercompany reinsurance transactions. The affiliated life insurers providing reinsurance capacity for such transactions are fully licensed insurance companies and are not formed under captive insurance laws. Under one of these intercompany reinsurance arrangements, certain Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves related to new and in-force business are ceded to an affiliated U.S. life insurer, which is a licensed life insurer in the state of Missouri and an accredited reinsurer in the state of Texas. As an accredited reinsurer, this affiliated life insurer is not required to post any collateral such as letters of credit or assets in trust.\nUnder the other intercompany reinsurance arrangement, certain Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves related to a closed block of in-force business are ceded to an affiliated off-shore life insurer, which is licensed as a class E insurer under Bermuda law. Bermuda law permits the off-shore life insurer to record an asset that effectively reduces the statutory reserves for the assumed reinsurance to the level that would be required under U.S. GAAP. Letters of credit are used to support the credit for reinsurance provided by the affiliated off-shore life insurer. The letters of credit are subject to reimbursement by AIG Parent in the event of a drawdown. See Note 8 for additional information regarding these letters of credit.\nItem 8 / note 20. STATUTORY FINANCIAL DATA AND RESTRICTIONS\nSubsidiary Dividend Restrictions\nPayments of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. With respect to our domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. For example, unless permitted by the Superintendent of Financial Services, property casualty companies domiciled in New York generally may not pay dividends to shareholders that, in any 12-month period, exceed the lesser of 10 percent of such company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus or 100 percent of its “adjusted net investment income,” for the previous year, as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both property casualty and life insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Other foreign jurisdictions may restrict the ability of our foreign insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Various other regulatory restrictions also limit cash loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries.\nLargely as a result of these restrictions, approximately $45.8 billion of the statutory capital and surplus of our consolidated insurance subsidiaries were restricted from transfer to AIG Parent without prior approval of state insurance regulators at December 31, 2014.\nTo our knowledge, no AIG insurance company is currently on any regulatory or similar “watch list” with regard to solvency.\nParent Company Dividend Restrictions\nOur ability to pay dividends has not been subject to any contractual restrictions since the cancellation of our Series G Preferred Stock in May 2011. See Note 17 herein for additional information about our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\n21. SHARE-BASED AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS\nThe following table presents our share-based compensation expense:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nShare-based compensation expense - pre-tax*\n$\n$\n$\nShare-based compensation expense - after tax\n* For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, $86 million, $315 million and $286 million of pre-tax compensation expense was attributed to unsettled liability-classified awards, the values of which are based on our share price at the reporting date. Our share price was $56.01, $51.05 and $35.30 at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we recognized $120 million and $101 million for immediately vested stock-settled awards issued to retirement eligible employees in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nEmployee Plans\nDuring 2014 and 2013, our employees were issued awards under the 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan, which is governed by the AIG 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2013 Plan). The 2013 Plan replaced the AIG 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (2010 Plan) as of May 15, 2013, but does not affect the terms or conditions of any award issued under the 2010 Plan. The 2013 Plan is currently the only plan under which share-based awards can be made.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Starr International Company, Inc. Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans (the SICO Plans) are the only legacy plans for which share-settled awards remain unvested.\nOur share-settled awards are settled with previously acquired shares held in AIG’s treasury. Share awards made by SICO are settled by SICO.\nItem 8 / note 20. STATUTORY FINANCIAL DATA AND RESTRICTIONS\nAIG 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nThe 2013 Plan was adopted at the 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and provides for the grants of share-based awards to our employees and non-employee directors. The total number of shares that may be granted under the 2013 Plan (the reserve) is the sum of 1) 45 million shares of AIG Common Stock, plus 2) the number of authorized shares that remained available for issuance under the 2010 Plan when the 2013 Plan became effective, plus 3) the number of shares of AIG Common Stock relating to outstanding awards under the 2010 Plan at the time the 2013 Plan became effective that subsequently are forfeited, expired, terminated or otherwise lapse or are settled in cash. Each share-based unit granted under the 2013 Plan reduces the number of shares available for future grants by one share. However, shares with respect to awards that are forfeited, expired or settled for cash, and shares withheld for taxes on awards (other than options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) awards) are returned to the reserve.\nDuring 2014, performance share units (PSUs) and deferred stock units (DSUs) were granted under the 2013 Plan and 50,206,557 shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2014. PSUs were issued for off-cycle grants, which are made from time to time during the year as sign-on awards to new hires or as a result of a change in employee status.\nAIG 2010 Stock Incentive Plan\nThe 2010 Plan was adopted at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock that could be granted under the 2010 Plan was 60 million. During 2013 and 2012, we granted PSUs, DSUs, and restricted stock units (RSUs), under the 2010 Plan. Each PSU, DSU, and RSU, awarded reduced the number of shares available for future grants by one share. Subsequent to the adoption of the 2013 Plan in May 2013, no additional grants were made under the 2010 Plan.\nShare-settled Awards\nAIG 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan\nThe 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan (2013 LTIP), adopted in March 2013, provides for the annual grant of PSUs to certain employees, including our senior executive officers and other highly compensated employees. Each recipient of an award is granted a number of PSUs (the target) that provides the opportunity to receive shares of AIG Common Stock based on AIG achieving specified performance goals at the end of a three-year performance period. These performance goals are pre-established by AIG’s Compensation and Management Resources Committee for each annual grant and may differ from year to year. The actual number of PSUs earned can vary from zero to 150 percent of the target depending on AIG’s performance relative to a specified peer group. Vesting occurs in three equal installments beginning on January 1 of the year immediately following the end of a performance period and January 1 of each of the next two years. Dividends do not accrue on unvested PSUs or underlying shares. Recipients must be employed at each vesting date to be entitled to share delivery, except upon the occurrence of an accelerated vesting event, such as an involuntary termination without cause, disability, or retirement during the vesting period.\nSICO Plans\nThe SICO Plans provide that shares of AIG Common Stock currently held by SICO are set aside for the benefit of the participant and distributed upon retirement. The SICO Board of Directors currently may permit an early payout of shares under certain circumstances. Prior to payout, the participant is not entitled to vote, dispose of or receive dividends with respect to such shares, and shares are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, including but not limited to the participant’s termination of employment with us prior to normal retirement age. A significant portion of the awards under the SICO Plans vest the year after the participant reaches age 65, provided that the participant remains employed by us through age 65. The portion of the awards for which early payout is available vests on the applicable payout date.\nSICO Plan awards issued in the form of restricted stock were valued based on the closing price of AIG’s Common Stock on the grant date. Although none of the costs of the various benefits provided under the SICO Plans have been paid by us, we have\nItem 8 / note 21. SHARE-BASED AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS\nrecorded compensation expense for the deferred compensation amounts payable to our employees by SICO, with an offsetting amount credited to Additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts deemed contributed by SICO.\nNon-Employee Plans\nOur non-employee directors, who serve on our Board of Directors, receive share-based compensation in the form of fully vested deferred stock units (DSUs) with delivery deferred until retirement from the Board. In 2014 and 2013, we granted to non-employee directors 28,477 and 25,735 DSUs, respectively, under the 2013 Plan and recognized expense of $1.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively; in 2012, we granted 19,434 DSUs, under the 2010 Plan and recognized $0.6 million of expense.\nPerformance Share Unit Valuation\nThe performance goals for long-term incentive awards granted in 2014 are AIG’s total shareholder return (TSR) and change in credit default swap (CDS) spread, weighted 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively, in each case relative to a specified peer group. The goals for the 2013 awards are AIG’s growth in tangible book value per share (TBVPS) (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) and TSR, weighted 50 percent each, in each case relative to a specified peer group. The fair value of PSUs to be earned based on AIG’s achieving growth in TBVPS and change in CDS spreads was based on the closing price of AIG Common Stock on the grant date, discounted by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid during the respective vesting periods. The fair value of PSUs to be earned based on AIG’s TSR relative to a specified peer group was determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of PSUs based on AIG’s TSR:\nExpected dividend yield(a)\n1.13\n%\n0.38\n%\nExpected volatility(b)\n23.66\n%\n30.79\n%\nRisk-free interest rate(c)\n0.76\n%\n0.50\n%\n(a) The dividend yield is the projected annualized AIG dividend yield estimated by Bloomberg Professional service as of the valuation date.\n(b) The expected volatility is based on the implied volatilities of actively traded stock options from the valuation date through the end of the PSU performance period as estimated by Bloomberg Professional service.\n(c) The risk-free interest rate is the continuously compounded interest rate for the term between the valuation date and the end of the performance period that is assumed to be constant and equal to the interpolated value between the closest data points on the U.S. dollar LIBOR-swap curve as of the valuation date.\nThe following table summarizes outstanding share-settled awards(a):\nWeighted Average\nNumber of PSUs(b)/Shares\nGrant-Date Fair Value\nAs of or for the Year\nAIG\nSICO\nAIG\nSICO\nEnded December 31, 2014\nPlans\nPlans\nPlans\nPlans\nUnvested, beginning of year\n5,195,408\n85,949\n$\n36.92\n$\n1,195.05\nGranted\n6,882,136\n-\n48.50\n-\nVested\n(3,566,014)\n(23,494)\n45.21\n85.60\nForfeited\n(408,821)\n(4,143)\n41.59\n1,181.04\nUnvested, end of year\n8,102,709\n58,312\n$\n42.89\n$\n1,191.01\n(a) Excludes DSUs and options, which are discussed under the Non-Employee Plans and Stock Options sections, respectively.\n(b) Represents target number of PSUs granted, and does not reflect potential increases or decreases that could result from the final outcome of the performance goals to be determined after the applicable performance period ends.\nAt December 31, 2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost (net of expected forfeitures) for the unvested PSUs and unvested restricted stock was $185 million and $19 million, respectively, and the weighted-average and expected period of years over which those costs are expected to be recognized are 1.28 years and 4 years for the PSUs, and 5.28 years and 25 years for the restricted stock, respectively.\nItem 8 / note 21. SHARE-BASED AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS\nStock Options\nOptions granted under the AIG 2007 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1999 Stock Option Plan generally vested over four years (25 percent vesting per year) and expire 10 years from the date of grant. All outstanding options are vested and out of the money at December 31, 2014. There were no stock options granted since 2008. The aggregate intrinsic value for all unexercised options is zero.\nThe following table provides a roll forward of stock option activity:\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nWeighted Average\nContractual\nAs of or for the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nShares\nExercise Price\nLife\nOptions:\nExercisable at beginning of year\n289,790\n$\n1,113.99\n2.58\nExpired\n(87,515)\n$\n1,290.22\nExercisable at end of year\n202,275\n$\n1,037.74\n2.17\nCash-settled Awards\nShare-based cash-settled awards are recorded as liabilities until the final payout is made or the award is replaced with a stock-settled award. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting periods, unless the award is fully vested on the grant date in which case the entire award value is immediately recognized as expense.\nUnlike stock-settled awards, which generally have a fixed grant-date fair value (unless the award is subsequently modified), the fair value of unsettled or unvested cash-settled awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one share of AIG Common Stock. The liability and corresponding expense are adjusted accordingly until the award is settled.\nDuring the period we were subject to Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) restrictions, we issued various cash-settled share-based grants, including Stock Salary, TARP RSU awards, and other cash-settled RSU awards, to certain of our most highly compensated employees and executive officers in the form of restricted stock units that were either fully vested with payment deferred, or subject to specified service and performance conditions. After the repayment of our TARP obligations in December 2012, all performance conditions were satisfied; as a result, we no longer issue awards that are subject to TARP restrictions.\nRestricted Stock Units\nStock Salary Awards\nStock Salary was earned and accrued at the same time or times as the salary would otherwise be paid in cash and is generally settled in installments on the first, second or third anniversary of grant in accordance with the terms of an employee’s award. Stock Salary grants were generally issued in the form of fully vested RSUs and are settled in cash based on the value of AIG Common Stock on the applicable settlement date. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we paid $89 million, $180 million and $111 million, respectively, to settle awards. For those awards that were vested and unsettled at the end of each year, we recognized charges of $7 million, $73 million and $173 million in compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, to reflect fluctuations in the value of AIG Common Stock. At December 31, 2014, the number of vested but unsettled RSUs totaled 742,317.\nItem 8 / note 21. SHARE-BASED AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS\nTARP and Other RSUs\nTARP RSUs awarded require the achievement of objective performance metrics as a condition to entitlement. An award would have been settled in 25 percent installments in proportion to the repayment of our TARP obligations. As a result of the repayment of our TARP obligations in December 2012, outstanding awards vest and settle in two 50 percent installments on the second and third anniversary of the date of grant, along with other cash-settled RSUs granted and issued in March 2013 and 2012.\nLong Term Incentive Plans\nCertain employees were provided the opportunity to receive additional compensation in the form of cash and cash-settled SARs under the 2011 LTIP or 100 percent cash for the 2012 LTIP if certain performance measures were met. The ultimate value of these awards was contingent on AIG achieving performance measures over a two-year performance period and such value could range from zero to twice the target amount. Subsequent to the performance period, the earned awards were subject to an additional time-vesting period. This results in a graded vesting schedule for the cash portion of up to two years, while the SARs portion cliff-vests two years after the end of performance period.\nThe cash portion of the awards expensed in 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled approximately $57 million, $249 million, and $189 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents a roll forward of SARs and cash-settled RSUs (excluding stock salary) as well as the related expenses:\nNumber of Units\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nTARP RSUs(a)\nOther RSUs(b)\nSARs(d)\nUnvested, beginning of year\n857,579\n1,563,687\n8,966,246\nGranted\n-\n-\n-\nVested(c)\n(529,049)\n(382,468)\n(5,521,171)\nForfeited\n(89,417)\n(15,687)\n(160,166)\nUnvested, end of year\n239,113\n1,165,532\n3,284,909\nNet compensation expense for the year (in millions)\n$\n$\n$\n(a) Total unrecognized compensation and the weighted-average period for which it will be recognized is $3 million and 0.55 year, respectively.\n(b) Total unrecognized compensation and the weighted-average period for which it will be recognized is $13 million and 0.61 year, respectively.\n(c) Also includes SARs for which vesting was accelerated for employees who became retirement eligible or were deceased.\n(d) The ending balance represents awards granted under the 2011 LTIP that vested on January 1, 2015 and were automatically exercised. The value of a SAR as of December 31, 2014 was determined based on the excess of the fair value (as defined) of one share of AIG Common Stock over the strike price of $37.40; the fair value was $55.29 based on the average of the closing sale prices on each trading day during the month of December 2014 in accordance with the plan provisions. No SARs are outstanding after January 1, 2015.\n22. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nPension Plans\nWe offer various defined benefit plans to eligible employees.\nThe U.S. AIG Retirement Plan (the qualified plan) is a noncontributory defined benefit plan, that is subject to the provisions of ERISA. U.S. salaried employees who are employed by a participating company and who have completed 12 months of continuous service are eligible to participate in the plan. Effective April 1, 2012, the qualified plan was converted to a cash balance formula comprised of pay credits based on six percent of a plan participant’s annual compensation (subject to IRS limitations) and annual interest credits. In addition, employees can take their vested benefits when they leave AIG as a lump sum or an annuity option after completing at least three years of service. However, employees satisfying certain age and service requirements (i.e. grandfathered employees) remain covered under the old plan formula, which is based upon a\nItem 8 / note 21. SHARE-BASED AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS\npercentage of final average compensation multiplied by years of credited service, up to 44 years. Grandfathered employees will receive the higher of the benefits under the cash balance or final average pay formula at retirement. Non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally either based on the employee’s years of credited service and compensation in the years preceding retirement or on points accumulated based on the employee’s job grade and other factors during each year of service.\nIn the U.S. we also sponsor several non-qualified unfunded defined benefit plans for certain employees, including key executives, designed to supplement pension benefits provided by the qualified plan. These include the AIG Non-Qualified Retirement Income Plan (AIG NQRIP), which provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits under the qualified plan as a result of federal tax limitations on compensation and benefits payable, and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), which provides additional retirement benefits to designated executives. Under the SERP, an annual benefit accrues at a percentage of final average pay multiplied by each year of credited service, not greater than 60 percent of final average pay, reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans (including the AIG NQRIP), Social Security, and any benefits accrued under a Company sponsored foreign deferred compensation plan.\nPostretirement Plans\nWe also provide postretirement medical care and life insurance benefits in the U.S. and in certain non-U.S. countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and attaining a specified age. Overseas, benefits vary by geographic location.\nU.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee attaining the age of 55 and having a minimum of ten years of service. Eligible employees who have medical coverage can enroll in retiree medical upon termination of employment. Medical benefits are contributory, while the life insurance benefits are generally non-contributory. Retiree medical contributions vary from none for pre-1989 retirees to actual premium payments reduced by certain subsidies for post-1992 retirees. These contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination. Effective April 1, 2012, the retiree medical employer subsidy for the AIG Postretirement plan was eliminated for employees who were not grandfathered. Additionally, new employees hired after December 31, 2012 are not eligible for retiree life insurance.\nThe following table presents the funded status of the plans reconciled to the amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement date for most of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is November 30, consistent with the fiscal year end of the sponsoring companies. For all other plans, measurement occurs as of December 31.\nAs of or for the Years Ended\nPension\nPostretirement(a)\nDecember 31,\nU.S. Plans(b)\nNon-U.S. Plans(b)\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n(in millions)\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year\n$\n4,882\n$\n5,161\n$\n1,072\n$\n1,205\n$\n$\n$\n$\nService cost\nInterest cost\nActuarial (gain) loss\n(454)\n(41)\n(15)\nBenefits paid:\nAIG assets\n(15)\n(14)\n(15)\n(13)\n(11)\n(10)\n(1)\n(1)\nPlan assets\n(279)\n(217)\n(24)\n(27)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPlan amendment\n-\n-\n(1)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCurtailments\n-\n-\n-\n(1)\n-\n-\n-\n(3)\nSettlements\n-\n-\n(9)\n(35)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nForeign exchange effect\n-\n-\n(107)\n(126)\n-\n-\n(2)\n(1)\nOther\n-\n-\n(2)\n(20)\n-\n-\n-\nProjected benefit obligation, end of year\n$\n5,769\n$\n4,882\n$\n1,099\n$\n1,072\n$\n$\n$\n$\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets, beginning\nof year\n$\n4,024\n$\n3,720\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nActual return on plan assets, net of expenses\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAIG contributions\nBenefits paid:\nAIG assets\n(15)\n(14)\n(15)\n(13)\n(11)\n(10)\n(1)\n(1)\nPlan assets\n(279)\n(217)\n(24)\n(27)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSettlements\n-\n-\n(8)\n(35)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nForeign exchange effect\n-\n-\n(75)\n(93)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther\n-\n-\n(46)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nFair value of plan assets, end of year\n$\n4,111\n$\n4,024\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nFunded status, end of year\n$\n(1,658)\n$\n(858)\n$\n(391)\n$\n(334)\n$\n(229)\n$\n(217)\n$\n(64)\n$\n(52)\nAmounts recognized in the balance\nsheet:\nAssets\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nLiabilities\n(1,658)\n(858)\n(437)\n(425)\n(229)\n(217)\n(64)\n(52)\nTotal amounts recognized\n$\n(1,658)\n$\n(858)\n$\n(391)\n$\n(334)\n$\n(229)\n$\n(217)\n$\n(64)\n$\n(52)\nPre-tax amounts recognized in Accumulated\nother comprehensive income:\nNet gain (loss)\n$\n(1,667)\n$\n(908)\n$\n(227)\n$\n(204)\n$\n(9)\n$\n$\n(8)\n$\nPrior service credit\nTotal amounts recognized\n$\n(1,467)\n$\n(674)\n$\n(216)\n$\n(190)\n$\n$\n$\n(7)\n$\nItem 8 / note 22.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nThe estimated net loss and prior service credit that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $141 million and $35 million, respectively, for our combined defined benefit pension plans. For the defined benefit postretirement plans, the estimated amortization from Accumulated other comprehensive income for net loss and prior service credit that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is a $10 million credit in the aggregate.\nThe annual pension expense in 2015 for the AIG U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately $289 million. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or expected long-term rate of return would decrease the 2015 expense by approximately $95 million and $47 million, respectively, with all other items remaining the same. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate or expected long-term rate of return would increase the 2015 expense by approximately $104 million and $47 million, respectively, with all other items remaining the same.\nAssumptions\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations:\nPension\nPostretirement\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans*\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans*\nDecember 31, 2014\nDiscount rate\n3.94\n%\n2.33\n%\n3.78\n%\n4.04\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.40\n%\n2.89\n%\nN/A\n3.29\n%\nDecember 31, 2013\nDiscount rate\n4.83\n%\n2.77\n%\n4.59\n%\n4.77\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.50\n%\n2.89\n%\nN/A\n3.34\n%\n* The non-U.S. plans reflect those assumptions that were most appropriate for the local economic environments of each of the subsidiaries providing such benefits.\nThe following table summarizes assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. plans:\nAt December 31,\nFollowing year:\nMedical (before age 65)\n7.07%\n7.21%\nMedical (age 65 and older)\n6.75%\n6.80%\nUltimate rate to which cost increase is assumed to decline\n4.50%\n4.50%\nYear in which the ultimate trend rate is reached:\nMedical (before age 65)\nMedical (age 65 and older)\nA one percent point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have the following effect on our postretirement benefit obligations:\nOne Percent\nOne Percent\nAt December 31,\nIncrease\nDecrease\n(in millions)\nU.S. plans\n$\n$\n$\n(5)\n$\n(3)\nNon-U.S. plans\n$\n$\n$\n(12)\n$\n(7)\nOur postretirement plans provide benefits primarily in the form of defined employer contributions rather than defined employer benefits. Changes in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate have a minimal impact for U.S. plans because for post-1992 retirees, benefits are fixed dollar amounts based on service at retirement. Our non-U.S. postretirement plans are not subject to caps.\nItem 8 / note 22.

The discount rates were 3.95 percent at December 31, 2014 and 4.84 percent at December 31, 2013. The methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. plans.\nIn general, the discount rates for non-U.S. pension plans were developed based on the duration of liabilities on a plan by plan basis and were selected by reference to high quality corporate bonds in developed markets or local government bonds where developed markets are not as robust or are nonexistent.\nThe projected benefit obligation for Japan represents approximately 47 percent and 51 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 1.22 percent and 1.39 percent at December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively for Japan was selected by reference to the AA rated corporate bonds reported by Rating and Investment Information, Inc. based on the duration of the plans’ liabilities.\nPlan Assets\nThe investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will (a) provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term (b) limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and (c) maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, diversification and concentration, and the risk and rewards profile applicable to each asset class. The assessment of the expected rate of return for all our plans is long-term and thus is not expected to change annually; however, significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions may warrant such a change.\nThere were no shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2014 or 2013.\nU.S. Pension Plan\nThe long-term strategic asset allocation is reviewed and revised approximately every three years. The plan’s assets are monitored by the investment committee and actively managed by the investment managers, which includes allocating the plan’s assets among approved asset classes within pre-approved ranges permitted by the strategic allocation.\nItem 8 / note 22. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nThe following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for the U.S. qualified plan and the target allocation:\nTarget\nActual\nActual\nAt December 31,\nAsset class:\nEquity securities\n%\n%\n%\nFixed maturity securities\n%\n%\n%\nOther investments\n%\n%\n%\nTotal\n%\n%\n%\nThe expected long-term rate of return for the plan was 7.25 percent for both 2014 and 2013. The expected rate of return is an aggregation of expected returns within each asset class category and incorporates the current and target asset allocations. The combination of the expected asset return and any contributions made by us are expected to maintain the plan’s ability to meet all required benefit obligations. The expected asset return for each asset class was developed based on an approach that considers key fundamental drivers of the asset class returns in addition to historical returns, current market conditions, asset volatility and the expectations for future market returns.\nNon-U.S. Pension Plans\nThe assets of the non-U.S. pension plans are held in various trusts in multiple countries and are invested primarily in equities and fixed maturity securities to maximize the long-term return on assets for a given level of risk.\nThe following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for Non-U.S. pension plans and the target allocation:\nTarget\nActual\nActual\nAt December 31,\nAsset class:\nEquity securities\n%\n%\n%\nFixed maturity securities\n%\n%\n%\nOther investments\n%\n%\n%\nCash and cash equivalents\n%\n%\n%\nTotal\n%\n%\n%\nThe assets of AIG’s Japan pension plans represent approximately 55 percent and 60 percent of total non-U.S. assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The expected long term rate of return was 1.24 percent and 1.15 percent, for 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is evaluated by the Japanese Pension Investment Committee on a quarterly and annual basis along with various investment managers, and is revised to achieve the optimal allocation to meet targeted funding levels if necessary. In addition, the funding policy is revised in accordance with local regulation every five years.\nThe expected weighted average long-term rate of return for all our non-U.S. pension plans was 2.93 percent and 2.60 percent for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. It is an aggregation of expected returns within each asset class that was generally developed based on the building block approach that considers historical returns, current market conditions, asset volatility and the expectations for future market returns.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value\nThe following table presents information about our plan assets and indicates the level of the fair value measurement based on the observability of the inputs used.

Based on our investment strategy, we had no significant concentrations of risks at December 31, 2014.\nThe U.S. pension plan holds a group annuity contract with U.S. Life, one of our subsidiaries, which totaled $26 million and $27 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nItem 8 / note 22.

Assets are transferred out of Level 1 when they are no longer transacted with sufficient frequency and volume in an active market. Conversely, assets are transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 when transaction volume and frequency are indicative of an active market. We had no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nTransfers of Level 3 Assets\nWe record transfers of assets into or out of Level 3 at their fair values as of the end of each reporting period, consistent with the date of the determination of fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we transferred certain investments in hedge funds into Level 3 as a result of limited market activity due to fund-imposed redemption restrictions.\nItem 8 / note 22. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nExpected Cash Flows\nFunding for the U.S. pension plan ranges from the minimum amount required by ERISA to the maximum amount that would be deductible for U.S. tax purposes. Contributed amounts in excess of the minimum amounts are deemed voluntary. Amounts in excess of the maximum amount would be subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. There are no minimum required cash contributions in 2015 for the AIG Retirement Plan. SERP, AIG NQRIP, and postretirement plan payments are deductible when paid to participants.\nOur annual pension contribution in 2015 is expected to be approximately $173 million for our U.S. and non-U.S. plans, including a $100 million contribution to the AIG Retirement Plan. These estimates are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors including our liquidity, market performance and management’s discretion.\nThe expected future benefit payments, net of participants’ contributions, with respect to the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, are as follows:\nPension\nPostretirement\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\n(in millions)\nPlans\nPlans\nPlans\nPlans\n$\n$\n$\n$\n2020-2024\n2,036\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe sponsor several defined contribution plans for U.S. employees that provide for pre-tax salary reduction contributions by employees. The most significant plan is the AIG Incentive Savings Plan, for which the Company’s matching contribution is 100 percent of the first six percent of a participant’s contributions, subject to the IRS-imposed limitations. Our pre-tax expenses associated with these plans were $156 million, $155 million and $133 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.\n23. OWNERSHIP\nA Schedule 13G/A filed February 17, 2015 reports aggregate ownership of 75,755,659 shares, or approximately 5.3 percent (based on the AIG Common Stock outstanding, as adjusted to reflect the warrants owned), of AIG Common Stock and warrants (51,283,896 shares plus 24,471,763 warrants) as of December 31, 2014, including securities beneficially owned, in the aggregate, by Bruce R. Berkowitz and various investment vehicles managed by Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C.\nA Schedule 13G/A filed on February 9, 2015 reports aggregate ownership of 87,211,630 shares, or approximately 6.2 percent (based on the AIG Common Stock outstanding) of AIG Common Stock as of December 31, 2014, by various subsidiaries of Blackrock, Inc.\nA Schedule 13G filed on February 11, 2015 reports aggregate ownership of 71,820,823 shares, or approximately 5.1 percent (based on the AIG Common Stock outstanding) of AIG Common Stock as of December 31, 2014, by The Vanguard Group, Inc. and various subsidiaries thereof.\nThe calculation of ownership interest for purposes of the AIG Tax Asset Protection Plan and Article 13 of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation is different than beneficial ownership for Schedule 13G.\nItem 8 / note 22.

The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $236 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $209 million related to a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $182 million of income excludible from gross income\nItem 8 / note 24. INCOME TAXES\nrelated to the global resolution of certain residential mortgage-related disputes and $68 million associated with effect of foreign operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 3.8 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $2.8 billion related to a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $396 million related to a decrease in certain other valuation allowances associated with foreign jurisdictions and $298 million associated with tax exempt interest income. These items were partially offset by charges of $632 million related to uncertain tax positions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2012, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was (27.9) percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to decreases in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance of $1.9 billion related to the actual and projected gains from the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ available-for-sale securities, and tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income of $302 million. These items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions of $446 million.\nThe following table presents the components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities):\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\nLosses and tax credit carryforwards\n$\n18,203\n$\n20,825\nBasis Differences on Investments\n4,114\n4,843\nLife Policy Reserves\nAccruals not currently deductible, and other\n1,804\n2,935\nInvestments in foreign subsidiaries\n(58)\n1,035\nLoss reserve discount\n1,378\n1,164\nLoan loss and other reserves\nUnearned premium reserve reduction\n1,269\n1,451\nEmployee benefits\n1,543\n1,217\nTotal deferred tax assets\n29,034\n34,803\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDeferred policy acquisition costs\n(3,003)\n(3,396)\nFlight equipment, fixed assets and intangible assets\n(2,354)\nUnrealized gains related to available for sale debt securities\n(5,795)\n(3,693)\nOther\n(571)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(8,550)\n(10,014)\nNet deferred tax assets before valuation allowance\n20,484\n24,789\nValuation allowance\n(1,739)\n(3,596)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n$\n18,745\n$\n21,193\nThe following table presents our U.S. consolidated income tax group tax losses and credits carryforwards as of December 31, 2014 on a tax return basis.\nDecember 31, 2014\nTax\nExpiration\n(in millions)\nGross\nEffected\nPeriods\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n$\n33,021\n$\n11,557\n2028 - 2031\nForeign tax credit carryforwards\n-\n7,109\n2016 - 2023\nOther carryforwards and other\n-\n1,034\nVarious\nTotal AIG U.S. consolidated income tax group tax losses and credits carryforwards\n$\n19,700\nAssessment of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\nThe evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax\nItem 8 / note 24. INCOME TAXES\nasset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\nOur framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires us to consider all available evidence, including:\n• the nature, frequency, and amount of cumulative financial reporting income and losses in recent years;\n• the sustainability of recent operating profitability of our subsidiaries;\n• the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;\n• the carryforward periods for the net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, including the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences; and,\n• prudent and feasible actions and tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset.\nAs a result of sales in the ordinary course of business to manage the investment portfolio and other transactions during the year ended December 31, 2014, remaining U.S. Life Insurance Companies capital loss carryforwards were realized prior to their expiration. This, together with the changes in market conditions, resulted in a conclusion that deferred tax assets related to unrealized tax losses in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ available for sale portfolio will more-likely-than-not be realized. Accordingly, the related deferred tax asset valuation allowance was released.\nTherefore, for the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a decrease of $1.8 billion in the capital loss carryforward valuation allowance associated with the U.S. Life Insurance Companies, of which $209 million was allocated to income from continuing operations and $1.6 billion was allocated to other comprehensive income. Included in the $1.8 billion was a decrease in the capital loss carryforward valuation allowance of $314 million related to a portion of the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward previously treated as expired that was restored and utilized in 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we also recognized a $325 million decrease in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain state, local and foreign jurisdictions, primarily attributable to a corresponding reduction in state and local deferred tax assets.\nThe following table presents the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2014 and 2013 on a U.S. GAAP basis:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nNet U.S. consolidated return group deferred tax assets\n$\n24,543\n$\n26,296\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(5,510)\n(3,337)\nValuation allowance\n(129)\n(1,650)\nSubtotal\n18,904\n21,309\nNet foreign, state and local deferred tax assets\n2,045\n2,563\nValuation allowance\n(1,610)\n(1,947)\nSubtotal\nSubtotal - Net U.S, foreign, state and local deferred tax assets\n19,339\n21,925\nNet foreign, state and local deferred tax liabilities\n(594)\n(732)\nTotal AIG net deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n$\n18,745\n$\n21,193\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance of U.S. Consolidated Income Tax Group\nAt December 31, 2014, and 2013, our U.S. consolidated income tax group had net deferred tax assets after valuation allowance of $18.9 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2014, and 2013, our U.S. consolidated income tax group had valuation allowances of $129 million and $1.7 billion, respectively.\nItem 8 / note 24. INCOME TAXES\nDeferred Tax Liability - Foreign, State and Local\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had net deferred tax liabilities of $159 million and $116 million, respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns.\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had deferred tax asset valuation allowances of $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns. We maintained these valuation allowances following our conclusion that we could not demonstrate that it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized. This was primarily due to factors such as cumulative losses in recent years and the inability to demonstrate profits within the specific jurisdictions over the relevant carryforward periods.\nTax Examinations and Litigation\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our eligible U.S. subsidiaries. Several U.S. subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements previously filed separate U.S. federal income tax returns and were not part of our U.S. consolidated income tax group. Income earned by subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable U.S. and foreign law.\nThe statute of limitations for all tax years prior to 2000 has expired for our consolidated federal income tax return. We are currently under examination for the tax years 2000 through 2006.\nOn March 20, 2008, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS for years 1997 to 1999. The Notice asserted that we owe additional taxes and penalties for these years primarily due to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross-border financing transactions. The transactions that are the subject of the Notice extend beyond the period covered by the Notice, and the IRS is challenging the later periods. It is also possible that the IRS will consider other transactions to be similar to these transactions. We have paid the assessed tax plus interest and penalties for 1997 to 1999. On February 26, 2009, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking a refund of approximately $306 million in taxes, interest and penalties paid with respect to its 1997 taxable year. We allege that the IRS improperly disallowed foreign tax credits and that our taxable income should be reduced as a result of the 2005 restatement of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe also filed an administrative refund claim on September 9, 2010 for our 1998 and 1999 tax years.\nOn March 29, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled on a motion for partial summary judgment that we filed on July 30, 2010 related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross-border financing transactions. The court denied our motion with leave to renew.\nOn August 1, 2012, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions. On March 29, 2013, the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York denied our motion for partial summary judgment related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions. On March 17, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Second Circuit) granted our petition for an immediate appeal of the partial summary judgment decision. Accordingly, we are presenting our position to the Second Circuit.\nWe will vigorously defend our position and continue to believe that we have adequate reserves for any liability that could result from the IRS actions.\nWe continue to monitor legal and other developments in this area and evaluate the effect, if any, on our position, including recent decisions adverse to other taxpayers.\nAccounting For Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nItem 8 / note 24. INCOME TAXES\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year\n$\n4,340\n$\n4,385\n$\n4,279\nIncreases in tax positions for prior years\nDecreases in tax positions for prior years\n(60)\n(796)\n(264)\nIncreases in tax positions for current year\nLapse in statute of limitations\n(6)\n(20)\n(8)\nSettlements\n-\n(2)\n(5)\nActivity of discontinued operations\n-\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year\n$\n4,395\n$\n4,340\n$\n4,385\nAt December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, were $4.4 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions that, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate because they relate to such factors as the timing, rather than the permissibility, of the deduction were $0.3 billion, $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively. Accordingly, at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate were $4.1 billion, $4.2 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.\nInterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense. At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had accrued liabilities of $1.1 billion for the payment of interest (net of the federal benefit) and penalties. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we accrued expense (benefits) of $21 million, $142 million and $192 million, respectively, for the payment of interest (net of the federal benefit) and penalties.\nWe regularly evaluate adjustments proposed by taxing authorities. At December 31, 2014, such proposed adjustments would not have resulted in a material change to our consolidated financial condition, although it is possible that the effect could be material to our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Although it is reasonably possible that a change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months, based on the information currently available, we do not expect any change to be material to our consolidated financial condition.\nListed below are the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions:\nAt December 31, 2014\nOpen Tax Years\nMajor Tax Jurisdiction\nUnited States\n2000-2013\nAustralia\n2010-2013\nFrance\n2012-2013\nJapan\n2008-2013\nKorea\n2009-2013\nSingapore\n2011-2013\nUnited Kingdom\nItem 8 / note 24.

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by AIG management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2014. Based on this evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of AIG is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. AIG’s internal control over financial reporting is a process, under the supervision of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of AIG’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAIG management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nAIG management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria articulated in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
